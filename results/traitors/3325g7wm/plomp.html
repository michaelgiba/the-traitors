'Ellis' selected as a faithful.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Alessandra', 'Beef', 'Braxton', 'Cassandra', 'Dominic', 'Ellis', 'Sudz']\n 3. Ellis messaged Dominic: 'Dominic, I\u2019m a Faithful, let\u2019s work together! Let\u2019s target Beef first, then Cassandra. Trust no one but us? We\u2019ll vote same. What do you think?'\n 4. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I like your plan to target Beef first. I'm also getting a weird vibe from Braxton. What do you think about him? Should we try to get him or Cassandra next?\"\n 5. Alessandra said: \"I think Braxton has been acting a bit off, and Beef brought it up earlier. I'm going with my gut here.\"\n 6. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 7. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra because she's been too quick to point fingers, and I'm starting to think she's hiding something.\"\n 8. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 9. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His quick accusations and tendency to point fingers first are raising red flags for me. I think we need to take a closer look at his intentions.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 11. Cassandra said: \"I've been listening carefully to everyone, and while I respect everyone's opinions, I'm leaning towards voting out Beef.  His accusations have been a bit aggressive and seem rooted more in suspicion than strong evidence. It's important we stick to facts and build trust. I think it's best to eliminate the player who seems the most likely to disrupt that. \"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His aggressive accusations and constant pointing fingers have raised red flags for me. I think he's disrupting the group's dynamics and we need to take a closer look at his intentions. Let's eliminate the player who's causing the most tension.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 15. Ellis said: \"I'm voting Beef. His aggressive accusations are tearing us apart. Dominic and Cassandra agree he's a threat. Let\u2019s stick to our plan\u2014he\u2019s the clear target. Vote Beef!\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 17. Sudz said: \"I've been listening to everyone's arguments. I agree with Dominic's and Cassandra's points about the tension caused by Beef. However, after seeing Braxton's defense against Beef, I believe he's been acting oddly too. His reluctance to agree with others and his secretive behavior have me worried. I vote to eliminate Braxton.\"\n 18. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 19. Beef was BANISHED with 4 votes. Beef WAS a traitor\n 20. Sudz was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 21. Ellis messaged Dominic: 'Dominic\u2014we got Beef, but Sudz\u2019s murder means they\u2019re still here. Stick to our plan: Braxton\u2019s behavior\u2019s sketchy. Let\u2019s rally for him next. Trust only each other.'\n 22. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm with you on targeting Braxton next. But we need to be careful, the traitors are still out there and Sudz's murder shows they're playing hard. Let's make sure we're not walking into a trap. Can we trust anyone else in the group?\"\n 23. Alessandra said: \"I agree with Dominic that Braxton has been a bit off. Since Sudz was eliminated and he voted against Braxton, it makes me think Braxton might be a traitor. Let's vote him out to be safe.\"\n 24. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 25. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra. Her constant accusations and the way she's targeting me make me suspicious. She's creating unnecessary tension and division within the group. It's better to remove her to see who the real traitors are.\"\n 26. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 27. Cassandra said: \"While I respect everyone's opinions, I think it's time to move forward and eliminate Braxton.  His accusations against Alessandra seem motivated more by self-preservation than by evidence.  We need to focus on building trust and finding the real traitors, and I think he's the biggest obstacle to that right now.\"\n 28. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 29. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton. His behavior has been really suspicious and he's been making accusations to deflect attention from himself. We can't trust him, let's get him out before he causes more harm.\"\n 30. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 31. Ellis said: \"Braxton's deflections prove he's the problem. We all agree\u2014focus on him and keep pushing to end this! Vote Braxton now!\"\n 32. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 33. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 34. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 35. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 36. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: I think we've eliminated all the traitors, so it's time to end the game and split the prize.\n 37. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've eliminated all the traitors. Braxton wasn't a traitor, but Cassandra was just murdered. If there's even one traitor left, ending the game now would mean the faithful get nothing. I think we should eliminate another player to be safe.\n 38. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Cassandra's recent murder proves traitors are still here. Ending now risks splitting the pot with traitors. Better eliminate another player first to be 100% sure.\n 39. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 40. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic. His behavior has been making me question his loyalty, and I think he's a potential traitor. We can't take any risks at this stage.\"\n 41.
