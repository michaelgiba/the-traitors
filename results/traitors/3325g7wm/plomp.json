Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've eliminated all the traitors. Braxton wasn't a traitor, but Cassandra was just murdered. If there's even one traitor left, ending the game now would mean the faithful get nothing. I think we should eliminate another player to be safe.\n 38. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Cassandra's recent murder proves traitors are still here. Ending now risks splitting the pot with traitors. Better eliminate another player first to be 100% sure.\n 39. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 40. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic. His behavior has been making me question his loyalty, and I think he's a potential traitor. We can't take any risks at this stage.\"\n 41. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis. Throughout this game, Ellis has been pushing to target certain players, but I think he's been trying to manipulate the group. His messages to me have been too convenient, and I suspect he might be a traitor. Alessandra and I are the only ones left who can still make a move. I don't trust Ellis, and I think we should eliminate him to be safe.\"\n 43.
