Killing him confuses others, making them suspect Braxton next, while we stay under the radar.\n 30. Dominic votes to murder Sudz: Sudz is paying close attention to others, especially Braxton, which makes him a potential threat.

This keeps us under the radar and allows us to stay hidden.\n 51. Ellis suggests murdering Beef: Beef\u2019s aggressive voting patterns make him an obvious suspect. Killing him lets the group blame him as the traitor, hiding our identities while destabilizing their remaining team.\n 52.

His elimination will create confusion, making others think he was a traitor, allowing us to stay hidden.\n 54. Ellis votes to murder Beef: Beef's active voting patterns make him the obvious fall guy.

Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 57. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, nice move on Cassandra. Let's keep up the good work.

Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Honestly, Ellis, I've noticed Beef's been acting nervously too. I'm keeping an eye on him. What do you think about Braxton? Is he too trusting for his own good?\"\n 6. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: \"Beef\u2019s tension is off. Braxton\u2019s openness feels genuine, but let's target Beef first\u2014at the Round Table. We can\u2019t miss this chance.\"\n 7.

Let's get her out and see how the game plays out.\"\n 10. Dominic voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 11. Ellis said: 'Listen, Gwendolyn\u2019s been way too quiet and cagey. This is our chance to cut the suspicious ones fast. Vote Gwendolyn out now!'\n 12. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 13. Braxton said: \"Alright, I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. I've noticed her behavior has been pretty inconsistent, and based on what I've heard from others, there's enough suspicion to make this move. Let's see what happens once she's out of the picture.\"\n 14. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 15. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting out Dominic. He's been awfully quiet the whole game and that kinda makes me nervous. I feel like he's biding his time and waiting for the right moment.

Removing him creates confusion and distracts others from our true motives.\n 31. Ellis votes to murder Sudz: Sudz's focus on Braxton could expose traitor patterns.

She's been very assertive in pushing to eliminate others, and her sudden push to get rid of me feels like a power grab.

This keeps us under the radar and allows us to stay hidden.\n 51. Ellis suggests murdering Beef: Beef\u2019s aggressive voting patterns make him an obvious suspect. Killing him lets the group blame him as the traitor, hiding our identities while destabilizing their remaining team.\n 52.

Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 57. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, nice move on Cassandra. Let's keep up the good work. I'm starting to think Fletcher might be our next target\u2014his behavior's been a bit off. What do you think? Let's make sure we're on the same page for the next round.\"\n 58. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, Fletcher\u2019s the prime move\u2014target him hard next. Keep our fronts airtight and vote aligned. Trust the plan; we\u2019re nailing this.'\n 59. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm with you on Fletcher. His behavior's been sketchy, and others are noticing. Let's push for him next; it should be an easy target. Great job so far, keep it up!\"\n 60. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, Fletcher\u2019s the next move\u2014bang the table for him. Keep us clean and focused. They\u2019ll jump on that. Stick to the script!'\n 61. Braxton messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, with all that's happened\u2014Gwendolyn, Cassandra, and now Beef being taken out\u2014it's clear the traitors are still out there. We need to stay sharp. I'm keeping a close eye on Dominic; his moves don't add up. What do you think we should focus on next? Let's make sure we're on the same page and protect ourselves.\"\n 62. Ellis messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Dominic's behavior could be a front to blend in. Let's rally against Fletcher\u2014he\u2019s been unstable and risky. Keep the heat on him, not Dominic. Focus sharp, trust the flow.\"\n 63. Braxton messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, why do you think we should focus on Fletcher instead of Dominic? I feel like Dominic's moves haven't added up, and I want to make sure we're on the same page. Can you share more about your reasoning?\"\n 64. Ellis messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, Fletcher\u2019s shifts are way more erratic\u2014he\u2019s a walking variable. Stick with the group\u2019s heat on him, not Dominic. Trust the chaos, we can\u2019t afford splits.'\n 65. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher because his behavior has been a bit off. He's been quiet and his actions seem unpredictable.
