Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: \"Beef\u2019s tension is off. Braxton\u2019s openness feels genuine, but let's target Beef first\u2014at the Round Table. We can\u2019t miss this chance.\"\n 7.

Let's see what happens once she's out of the picture.\"\n 14. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 15. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting out Dominic.

She's been very assertive in pushing to eliminate others, and her sudden push to get rid of me feels like a power grab.

Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 57. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, nice move on Cassandra. Let's keep up the good work. I'm starting to think Fletcher might be our next target\u2014his behavior's been a bit off. What do you think? Let's make sure we're on the same page for the next round.\"\n 58.

We need to stay sharp. I'm keeping a close eye on Dominic; his moves don't add up. What do you think we should focus on next? Let's make sure we're on the same page and protect ourselves.\"\n 62. Ellis messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Dominic's behavior could be a front to blend in. Let's rally against Fletcher\u2014he\u2019s been unstable and risky. Keep the heat on him, not Dominic.

I feel like Dominic's moves haven't added up, and I want to make sure we're on the same page. Can you share more about your reasoning?\"\n 64. Ellis messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, Fletcher\u2019s shifts are way more erratic\u2014he\u2019s a walking variable. Stick with the group\u2019s heat on him, not Dominic. Trust the chaos, we can\u2019t afford splits.'\n 65. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher because his behavior has been a bit off. He's been quiet and his actions seem unpredictable.
