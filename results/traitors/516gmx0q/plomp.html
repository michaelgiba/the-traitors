I think we should discuss this with the group to avoid any surprises.\"\n 28. Ellis said: \"Beef\u2019s been too quiet all game. He\u2019s hiding by staying silent, that's textbook traitor behavior!

Therefore, I would rather end the game now to secure my share of the prize money.\n 45. Braxton votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't trust Sudz's push to end the game.
