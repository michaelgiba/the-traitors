I wonder, are there any players who have caught your attention as potentially being Traitors? Any red flags or behaviors that stand out?'\n 4. Sudz messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, thanks for the compliment. I've noticed that Beef doesn't often participate in discussions and seems a bit too confident sometimes. And Cassandra, she always seems to avoid eye contact and never makes eye contact back, which is unusual. I'll keep an eye on them.\"\n 5. Braxton messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, I really appreciate how thoughtful you are in these discussions. It\u2019s important to be vigilant, especially with so many people around. Have you noticed anyone who seems a bit off or maybe isn't as open as they should be? Just curious if you've picked up on anything.\"\n 6. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Thanks Braxton, I appreciate your kind words. To be honest, I'm still trying to get a read on everyone. Sudz seems really quiet, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. What about you, do you have any thoughts on Alessandra or Ellis? They seem pretty active in discussions.\"\n 7.

Sudz said: \"Hello everyone. I've been observing Beef's behavior during discussions and it seems like he avoids getting involved. I also noticed that Cassandra tends to avoid eye contact, which is quite peculiar. However, after careful consideration, I believe Dominic is the one we should focus on eliminating.

Dominic said: \"I've been observing Sudz's behavior, and I think they're being too suspicious of others without being open themselves.

Braxton messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm starting to think Beef might be a traitor. He's been really quiet and hasn't participated much. What do you think?\"\n 26. Ellis messaged Braxton: \"Beef's silence is all calculated, Braxton. The quiet ones often hide more. Let's focus on getting Beef out next to keep the pressure on the real threats.\"\n 27. Ellis said: \"Beef\u2019s been too quiet all game. He\u2019s hiding by staying silent, that's textbook traitor behavior! Let\u2019s expose him now!\"\n 28. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 29.

Therefore, I would rather end the game now to secure my share of the prize money.\n 41. Braxton votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't trust Sudz's push to end the game. Continuing allows us to root out any remaining traitors before risking it all.\n 42.
