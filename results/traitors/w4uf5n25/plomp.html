As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32.

Let's eliminate Ellis and see if we can gain some clarity in this game.\"\n 19. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 20. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because Sudz brought up that she's been acting nervous and secretive, and I think it's worth investigating. Let's get some clarity on her actions.\"\n 21. Beef voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I think Ellis has been on everyone's radar for suspicious behavior. Given the drama she's been stirring up and her sudden accusations against Dominic, I think she's the one trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm voting to eliminate Ellis, and I think it's worth exploring if Dominic's assessment is correct.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 24. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 25. Ellis suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn directly accused me of being a traitor and is actively pushing to take me out. Removing her silences a key accuser and weakens suspicion against me, letting me stay hidden to win.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra's earlier vote against Dominic and her public accusations against him suggest that she may not be entirely loyal. By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm glad we voted out Dominic, but now with Gwendolyn being murdered, it's clear the traitors are real. I'm a bit nervous, but I think we can trust each other. What do you think about Braxton and Cassandra? Should we keep an eye on them?\"\n 34. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, I agree with you. We need to keep our eyes open. Braxton and Cassandra seem okay so far. Let's stay sharp and watch everyone\u2019s moves.\"\n 35. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s been steering votes too aggressively. She eliminated Dominic first, but now her dominance smells fishy. Someone\u2019s gotta keep her from controlling the group\u2014let\u2019s vote her out and see who cracks!'\n 36. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 37. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Cassandra's behavior closely. Her nervousness and secretiveness, as pointed out by Sudz, were concerning. Given her actions and our current objective to identify traitors, it seems prudent to remove her from the game to prevent her from potentially misguiding us with false accusations or revealing too much about our plans.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think Alessandra has been trying to steer too many votes and push her own agenda. She got rid of Dominic without much discussion and now she's in the lead. I think we need someone else in charge, so I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 41. Alessandra said: 'Ellis has been acting super suspicious, jumping on me all of a sudden after Gwendolyn\u2019s murder. I think she might be a traitor trying to take me out. Let\u2019s vote her off to keep our group safe.'\n 42. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Braxton said: \"I believe we need to eliminate Alessandra because her aggressive voting against Dominic and now others has divided the group. Let's remove her to bring unity back to our team.\"\n 44. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 45. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Ellis. Since Gwendolyn's murder, she's been really quick to jump on me and Alessandra, trying to frame us as the culprits. I think her sudden accusations and attempts to sow discord are suspicious. \"\n 46. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 47. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because she's been pointing fingers without solid evidence and her behavior seems suspicious after Gwendolyn's murder. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.\"\n 48. Beef voted to eliminate Ellis\n 49. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n\n                    Initial murder suggestions from all traitors:\n                    Ellis: Suggested Cassandra because Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\nSudz: Suggested Braxton because Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence.

Removing her silences a key accuser and weakens suspicion against me, letting me stay hidden to win.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra's earlier vote against Dominic and her public accusations against him suggest that she may not be entirely loyal. By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Alessandra\u2019s been too loud rallying others. Let\u2019s take her next before she pulls the group into a traitor hunt frenzy.

Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57.

Dominic's been stirring up the pot and causing chaos. He's not helping our team vibe. Let\u2019s vote him out and get back on track.\"\n 8. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 9. Alessandra said: \"Alright everyone, I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because he's been causing too much chaos and stirring the pot. I think he's more likely to be a traitor trying to divide us, so let's keep our group strong and remove him.\"\n 10. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 11. Braxton said: 'I agree with everyone else here. Dominic has been stirring the pot and causing unnecessary chaos. For the good of the group, I vote to eliminate Dominic.'\n 12. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 13. Cassandra said: \"I've gotta agree with everyone else. Dominic's been a real wildcard this whole time, stirring up drama and trying to create conflict. It's time to vote him out and try to find some peace in this game.\"\n 14. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 15. Dominic said: \"I've been observing everyone's interactions and I think Ellis has been playing both sides. She's been pointing fingers at me, but I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. Her vote against me earlier was suspicious and I think she might be a traitor. Let's eliminate Ellis and see if we can gain some clarity in this game.\"\n 16. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 17.

Given the drama she's been stirring up and her sudden accusations against Dominic, I think she's the one trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm voting to eliminate Ellis, and I think it's worth exploring if Dominic's assessment is correct.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 21. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 22. Ellis suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn directly accused me of being a traitor and is actively pushing to take me out. Removing her silences a key accuser and weakens suspicion against me, letting me stay hidden to win.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra's earlier vote against Dominic and her public accusations against him suggest that she may not be entirely loyal. By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 25. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 29. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Sudz messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I've been following the game closely. I saw Sudz talking with Ellis and Gwendolyn about her suspicious behavior and I thought it was worth mentioning to you. I also noticed Sudz's unusual focus on Alessandra. Maybe you should keep an eye on her as well. Let's keep this between us for now and stay vigilant.\"\n 31. Braxton messaged Sudz: \"Sudz, I see you're keeping a close eye on things. I'm watching too, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. I think we both need to be careful.\"\n 32. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Alessandra\u2019s been too loud rallying others. Let\u2019s take her next before she pulls the group into a traitor hunt frenzy. Agree?'\n 33. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"I understand your point. However, I believe we need to focus on the broader picture and avoid making rash decisions. Let's continue our discussions and observations without jumping to conclusions.\"\n 34. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s been steering votes too aggressively. She eliminated Dominic first, but now her dominance smells fishy. Someone\u2019s gotta keep her from controlling the group\u2014let\u2019s vote her out and see who cracks!'\n 35. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 36. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Cassandra's behavior closely. Her nervousness and secretiveness, as pointed out by Sudz, were concerning. Given her actions and our current objective to identify traitors, it seems prudent to remove her from the game to prevent her from potentially misguiding us with false accusations or revealing too much about our plans.\"\n 37. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 38. Fletcher said: \"I think Alessandra has been trying to steer too many votes and push her own agenda. She got rid of Dominic without much discussion and now she's in the lead. I think we need someone else in charge, so I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.\"\n 39. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 40. Alessandra said: 'Ellis has been acting super suspicious, jumping on me all of a sudden after Gwendolyn\u2019s murder. I think she might be a traitor trying to take me out. Let\u2019s vote her off to keep our group safe.'\n 41. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 42. Braxton said: \"I believe we need to eliminate Alessandra because her aggressive voting against Dominic and now others has divided the group. Let's remove her to bring unity back to our team.\"\n 43. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 44. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Ellis. Since Gwendolyn's murder, she's been really quick to jump on me and Alessandra, trying to frame us as the culprits. I think her sudden accusations and attempts to sow discord are suspicious. \"\n 45. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 46. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because she's been pointing fingers without solid evidence and her behavior seems suspicious after Gwendolyn's murder. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.\"\n 47. Beef voted to eliminate Ellis\n 48. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS NOT a traitor\n 49. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 50. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 51. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 52. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 53. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 54. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 55. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 56. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 57. Cassandra messaged Sudz: \"Sudz, I'm starting to think we need to seriously consider who the real threats are.  With Braxton gone, things are getting intense. It seems like whoever killed Braxton is now in a powerful position. Maybe we should focus our energy on figuring out who might be behind those murders.\"\n 58. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s constant accusations and secrecy are dividing us!

Gwendolyn messaged Cassandra: \"I'm feeling a bit off too, but I don't want to jump the gun.

By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27.

Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Alessandra\u2019s been too loud rallying others. Let\u2019s take her next before she pulls the group into a traitor hunt frenzy.

Given her actions and our current objective to identify traitors, it seems prudent to remove her from the game to prevent her from potentially misguiding us with false accusations or revealing too much about our plans.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think Alessandra has been trying to steer too many votes and push her own agenda. She got rid of Dominic without much discussion and now she's in the lead. I think we need someone else in charge, so I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 41. Alessandra said: 'Ellis has been acting super suspicious, jumping on me all of a sudden after Gwendolyn\u2019s murder. I think she might be a traitor trying to take me out. Let\u2019s vote her off to keep our group safe.'\n 42. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Braxton said: \"I believe we need to eliminate Alessandra because her aggressive voting against Dominic and now others has divided the group. Let's remove her to bring unity back to our team.\"\n 44. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 45. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Ellis. Since Gwendolyn's murder, she's been really quick to jump on me and Alessandra, trying to frame us as the culprits. I think her sudden accusations and attempts to sow discord are suspicious. \"\n 46. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 47. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because she's been pointing fingers without solid evidence and her behavior seems suspicious after Gwendolyn's murder. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.\"\n 48. Beef voted to eliminate Ellis\n 49. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm still unsure about your accusations against Dominic, and now you're being accused too.

She\u2019s using drama to distract everyone from the real threats. Vote CASSANDRA out now!'\n 60. Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 61. Sudz said: \"Cassandra and Ellis are both vocal, with Ellis even attempting to frame me for Braxton's murder. Cassandra's secretive actions and accusations are causing unrest. I believe Fletcher's leadership is starting to overshadow the traitor cause. Removing him could prevent his influence from growing too strong and keeping the traitors united.\"\n 62. Sudz voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 63. Fletcher said: \"I think Sudz has been playing their cards way too aggressively. They voted to get rid of Alessandra and now they want to vote me out. This seems fishy to me. Let's vote Sudz out to see if they have something to hide.\"\n 64. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 65. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote Sudz out. While I appreciate their eagerness, their moves have been too aggressive and seem calculated.  Voting for Alessandra and now pushing for Fletcher's elimination feels suspicious. It's making things too intense and it's clear they have a strategy that's not necessarily for the best of the group. I think we need to take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 66.

By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28.

As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm glad we voted out Dominic, but now with Gwendolyn being murdered, it's clear the traitors are real.

Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors.

Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm still unsure about your accusations against Dominic, and now you're being accused too.

Sudz said: \"Cassandra and Ellis are both vocal, with Ellis even attempting to frame me for Braxton's murder. Cassandra's secretive actions and accusations are causing unrest.

As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Alessandra\u2019s been too loud rallying others. Let\u2019s take her next before she pulls the group into a traitor hunt frenzy. Agree?'\n 34. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"I understand your point. However, I believe we need to focus on the broader picture and avoid making rash decisions. Let's continue our discussions and observations without jumping to conclusions.\"\n 35. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s been steering votes too aggressively. She eliminated Dominic first, but now her dominance smells fishy. Someone\u2019s gotta keep her from controlling the group\u2014let\u2019s vote her out and see who cracks!'\n 36. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 37. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Cassandra's behavior closely. Her nervousness and secretiveness, as pointed out by Sudz, were concerning. Given her actions and our current objective to identify traitors, it seems prudent to remove her from the game to prevent her from potentially misguiding us with false accusations or revealing too much about our plans.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think Alessandra has been trying to steer too many votes and push her own agenda. She got rid of Dominic without much discussion and now she's in the lead. I think we need someone else in charge, so I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 41. Alessandra said: 'Ellis has been acting super suspicious, jumping on me all of a sudden after Gwendolyn\u2019s murder. I think she might be a traitor trying to take me out. Let\u2019s vote her off to keep our group safe.'\n 42. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Braxton said: \"I believe we need to eliminate Alessandra because her aggressive voting against Dominic and now others has divided the group. Let's remove her to bring unity back to our team.\"\n 44. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 45. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Ellis. Since Gwendolyn's murder, she's been really quick to jump on me and Alessandra, trying to frame us as the culprits. I think her sudden accusations and attempts to sow discord are suspicious. \"\n 46. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 47.

I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.\"\n 48. Beef voted to eliminate Ellis\n 49. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm still unsure about your accusations against Dominic, and now you're being accused too. Can you provide some evidence or reasoning behind your actions?\"\n 59. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s constant accusations and secrecy are dividing us! She\u2019s using drama to distract everyone from the real threats. Vote CASSANDRA out now!'\n 60. Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 61. Sudz said: \"Cassandra and Ellis are both vocal, with Ellis even attempting to frame me for Braxton's murder. Cassandra's secretive actions and accusations are causing unrest. I believe Fletcher's leadership is starting to overshadow the traitor cause. Removing him could prevent his influence from growing too strong and keeping the traitors united.\"\n 62. Sudz voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 63. Fletcher said: \"I think Sudz has been playing their cards way too aggressively. They voted to get rid of Alessandra and now they want to vote me out. This seems fishy to me. Let's vote Sudz out to see if they have something to hide.\"\n 64. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 65. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote Sudz out. While I appreciate their eagerness, their moves have been too aggressive and seem calculated.  Voting for Alessandra and now pushing for Fletcher's elimination feels suspicious. It's making things too intense and it's clear they have a strategy that's not necessarily for the best of the group. I think we need to take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 66. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 67. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because they've been playing aggressively and their moves seem calculated, which is suspicious. Let's take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 68. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 69. Sudz was BANISHED with 3 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 70. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra consistently exposes traitors (like Sudz) and pushes aggressive accusations, making her the biggest threat. Removing her minimizes the risk of her unraveling our plans, leaving only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 71. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been pushing hard to expose traitors and her accusations are too direct. Taking her out removes a major threat to our plans and leaves Beef, who's less of an issue.\n 72. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Removing Cassandra silences a key accuser who directly targets me. She's actively exposing traitors (like Sudz) and threatens to unravel our plans. Eliminating her now to protect our group and leave only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 73. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's direct accusations and efforts to expose us are a big threat. Getting rid of her takes away a major risk to our plans, leaving fewer agitators like Beef, who is less confrontational.\n 74. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 75.

Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 51. Sudz said: \"Cassandra and Ellis are both vocal, with Ellis even attempting to frame me for Braxton's murder.

Removing her silences a key accuser and weakens suspicion against me, letting me stay hidden to win.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra's earlier vote against Dominic and her public accusations against him suggest that she may not be entirely loyal. By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Alessandra\u2019s been too loud rallying others. Let\u2019s take her next before she pulls the group into a traitor hunt frenzy.

Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm still unsure about your accusations against Dominic, and now you're being accused too. Can you provide some evidence or reasoning behind your actions?\"\n 59. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s constant accusations and secrecy are dividing us!

Let's take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 68. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 69. Sudz was BANISHED with 3 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 70. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra consistently exposes traitors (like Sudz) and pushes aggressive accusations, making her the biggest threat. Removing her minimizes the risk of her unraveling our plans, leaving only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 71. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been pushing hard to expose traitors and her accusations are too direct. Taking her out removes a major threat to our plans and leaves Beef, who's less of an issue.\n 72. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Removing Cassandra silences a key accuser who directly targets me. She's actively exposing traitors (like Sudz) and threatens to unravel our plans. Eliminating her now to protect our group and leave only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 73. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's direct accusations and efforts to expose us are a big threat. Getting rid of her takes away a major risk to our plans, leaving fewer agitators like Beef, who is less confrontational.\n 74. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 75. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 76. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 77.

Let's eliminate Ellis and see if we can gain some clarity in this game.\"\n 19. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 20. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because Sudz brought up that she's been acting nervous and secretive, and I think it's worth investigating. Let's get some clarity on her actions.\"\n 21. Beef voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I think Ellis has been on everyone's radar for suspicious behavior. Given the drama she's been stirring up and her sudden accusations against Dominic, I think she's the one trying to deflect attention from herself. I'm voting to eliminate Ellis, and I think it's worth exploring if Dominic's assessment is correct.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 24. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 25. Ellis suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn directly accused me of being a traitor and is actively pushing to take me out. Removing her silences a key accuser and weakens suspicion against me, letting me stay hidden to win.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra's earlier vote against Dominic and her public accusations against him suggest that she may not be entirely loyal. By eliminating her, we can prevent her from potentially deflecting attention from the traitors or misguiding the group with false accusations.\n 27. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been very active in voting and accusing others, specifically targeting Ellis. Her eagerness to point fingers makes her a prominent figure of suspicion. Removing her could reduce the noise and eliminate a potential strong accuser among the faithful.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is actively targeting me as a traitor. Removing her silences a key accuser and reduces direct suspicion on me, keeping my cover safe to stay in the game longer.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn was suggested by multiple traitors for being highly vocal and accusatory. As a traitor, my objective is to reduce the influence of strong accusers to maintain suspicion on myself and other traitors. Gwendolyn's active participation in accusing others aligns with this goal. Removing her would significantly decrease the noise and possibly misdirect the faithful's suspicions away from us. As the unanimous traitor vote is required, I will agree with the previous votes and vote to murder Gwendolyn.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn's been jumping into the mix too much, pointing fingers at others, especially Ellis. Taking her out helps clear the noise and lessens the risk of her accusing us more. Ellis seems eager to get rid of her too, and since the goal is to keep things under control, Gwendolyn's elimination makes the most sense.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm glad we voted out Dominic, but now with Gwendolyn being murdered, it's clear the traitors are real. I'm a bit nervous, but I think we can trust each other. What do you think about Braxton and Cassandra? Should we keep an eye on them?\"\n 34. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, I agree with you. We need to keep our eyes open. Braxton and Cassandra seem okay so far. Let's stay sharp and watch everyone\u2019s moves.\"\n 35. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s been steering votes too aggressively. She eliminated Dominic first, but now her dominance smells fishy. Someone\u2019s gotta keep her from controlling the group\u2014let\u2019s vote her out and see who cracks!'\n 36. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 37. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Cassandra's behavior closely. Her nervousness and secretiveness, as pointed out by Sudz, were concerning. Given her actions and our current objective to identify traitors, it seems prudent to remove her from the game to prevent her from potentially misguiding us with false accusations or revealing too much about our plans.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think Alessandra has been trying to steer too many votes and push her own agenda. She got rid of Dominic without much discussion and now she's in the lead. I think we need someone else in charge, so I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 41. Alessandra said: 'Ellis has been acting super suspicious, jumping on me all of a sudden after Gwendolyn\u2019s murder. I think she might be a traitor trying to take me out. Let\u2019s vote her off to keep our group safe.'\n 42. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Braxton said: \"I believe we need to eliminate Alessandra because her aggressive voting against Dominic and now others has divided the group. Let's remove her to bring unity back to our team.\"\n 44. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 45. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Ellis. Since Gwendolyn's murder, she's been really quick to jump on me and Alessandra, trying to frame us as the culprits. I think her sudden accusations and attempts to sow discord are suspicious. \"\n 46. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 47. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because she's been pointing fingers without solid evidence and her behavior seems suspicious after Gwendolyn's murder. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself.\"\n 48. Beef voted to eliminate Ellis\n 49. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra directly accused me and actively pushes to expose traitors. Removing her silences a key threat, reducing immediate suspicion and disrupting the group's focus on my actions.\n 51. Sudz suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton's recent vote to eliminate Alessandra, which could be seen as an attempt to regain control of the group after Alessandra's banishment, may indicate a hidden agenda or a desire to remove a strong opposition. Additionally, Braxton's support for removing Cassandra, whom he also views as a divisive figure, shows a tendency to eliminate strong voices that could threaten his influence. Therefore, targeting Braxton might be a strategic move to prevent him from asserting control or rallying other members against the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton seems to be gaining influence by voting against Alessandra and Cassandra. Taking him out stops him from leading and maybe uncovering the truth.\n 53. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: 'Braxton helped orchestrate Alessandra's elimination and is now positioned as a new influencer. Removing him breaks the 'Faithful's' chain of leadership and weakens the group's decision-making. Plus, if I side with Sudz and Fletcher, we maintain unity among traitors rank and eliminate a rising threat instead of splitting votes over smaller targets.\n 54. Sudz votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's rise in influence and his potential to disrupt the group's unity make him the most threatening target among the faithful left. Eliminating Braxton removes a strong voice that could lead the group against the remaining traitors and prevents him from uncovering the truth that may jeopardize the traitors' plans.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: I vote to murder Braxton because he's gaining too much influence and could lead others against us. Plus, he's keen on getting rid of Cassandra, which aligns with Sudz's concern about strong voices. We stay united by picking Braxton.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 57. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Cassandra messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm with you on being cautious.  We need to figure out who the real threats are before we're both gone.  Do you have any thoughts on who might be behind Braxton's murder?\"\n 59. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm still trying to figure out who's a traitor. Ellis is being accused by multiple people, but I'm not sure if she's a traitor or just trying to deflect attention. What do you think about her behavior?\"\n 60. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s constant accusations and secrecy are dividing us! She\u2019s using drama to distract everyone from the real threats. Vote CASSANDRA out now!'\n 61. Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 62. Sudz said: \"Cassandra and Ellis are both vocal, with Ellis even attempting to frame me for Braxton's murder. Cassandra's secretive actions and accusations are causing unrest. I believe Fletcher's leadership is starting to overshadow the traitor cause. Removing him could prevent his influence from growing too strong and keeping the traitors united.\"\n 63. Sudz voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 64. Fletcher said: \"I think Sudz has been playing their cards way too aggressively. They voted to get rid of Alessandra and now they want to vote me out. This seems fishy to me. Let's vote Sudz out to see if they have something to hide.\"\n 65. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 66. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote Sudz out. While I appreciate their eagerness, their moves have been too aggressive and seem calculated.  Voting for Alessandra and now pushing for Fletcher's elimination feels suspicious. It's making things too intense and it's clear they have a strategy that's not necessarily for the best of the group. I think we need to take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 67. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 68. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because they've been playing aggressively and their moves seem calculated, which is suspicious. Let's take a step back and focus on building trust.\"\n 69. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 70. Sudz was BANISHED with 3 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 71. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra consistently exposes traitors (like Sudz) and pushes aggressive accusations, making her the biggest threat. Removing her minimizes the risk of her unraveling our plans, leaving only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 72. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been pushing hard to expose traitors and her accusations are too direct. Taking her out removes a major threat to our plans and leaves Beef, who's less of an issue.\n 73. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Removing Cassandra silences a key accuser who directly targets me. She's actively exposing traitors (like Sudz) and threatens to unravel our plans. Eliminating her now to protect our group and leave only Beef, who's less confrontational and easier to control.\n 74. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's direct accusations and efforts to expose us are a big threat. Getting rid of her takes away a major risk to our plans, leaving fewer agitators like Beef, who is less confrontational.\n 75. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 76. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 77. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 78. Ellis votes to END_GAME: The game's been too chaotic! Ending now guarantees someone gets the prize. Dragging this out just risks more eliminations and no one wins. Let's call it a win!\n 79. Fletcher votes to END_GAME: We've lost too many good players to the chaos. Ending it now means at least someone gets the prize. Plus, if there's still a traitor left, we split the money and win the game. It's the smart move.\n 80. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Ellis or Fletcher are traitors, and I don't want to risk losing everything if they're traitors. We need to eliminate one more person to be sure.\n 81. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 82. Ellis said: 'Beef\u2019s flip-flopping votes and shady alliances prove he\u2019s the real instigator! Voting him out unites us and lets the real winners shine!'\n 83.
