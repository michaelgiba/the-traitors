Gwendolyn messaged Braxton: \"I think Ellis voting for Beef might've been a distraction. Beef wouldn't have been a traitor, Ellis was. And Ellis said Beef was quiet until he spoke up, but that's the same thing Ellis did. I think a traitor is still making moves in our group to confuse us.\"\n 25. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn's been asking a lot of questions lately, especially about Beef. It's like she's setting up her own accusations.

Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Cassandra's being honest about ending the game. If there's still a traitor among us, they might be trying to end it to take the pot. Let's eliminate one more person to be sure.\n 71. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 72. Cassandra said: \"I've been closely watching both Dominic and Beef. Dominic has been pushing to continue the game, even though it means risking a potential traitor taking the whole pot.  This could be a sign of deep suspicion and a desire to eliminate the uncertainty. While Beef has seemed a little quieter, it's his hesitation to trust us and his vote to continue at this stage that feels more problematic. It's time to narrow it down and make a decisive move. I'm voting Dominic out to see what his true intentions are.\"\n 73. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 74. Dominic said: \"Cassandra's been trying to control the narrative from the start, and now she's trying to eliminate me. I think she's the bigger threat. Let's remove her.\"\n 75. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n                You, Beef, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Cassandra', 'Dominic'].
