Gwendolyn messaged Beef: \"Honestly, Beef, I think you might've done us a favor by pointing out Ellis's suspicious behavior. It's given me time to think about what really happened, and I'm starting to wonder if we were played all along.\"\n 55. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn has been asking a lot of questions, especially about Beef. It's like she's setting up her own accusations. I feel like she's trying to control the narrative and figure out who's who. We need to cut her off before she starts pointing fingers at the wrong people.\"\n 56. Cassandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 57. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her voting history and accusations have been too focused on Beef, who we know is a Faithful. Her behavior is suspicious, and I think she's trying to control the narrative to distract us from the real traitors. Let's take her out to see what she's really up to.\"\n 58. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 59. Dominic said: \"Cassandra's been really focused on Gwendolyn and Beef, but I think she's trying to throw us off. Let's remove her to see what's going on.\"\n 60. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 61. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her vote against me was suspicious, and she's been questioning a lot about my actions. I think she's trying to figure out who's a traitor and who's not, but her behavior is too controlling. Let's eliminate her to see what's really going on.\"\n 62. Beef voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 63. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Cassandra because all of her votes have been based on speculation and assumptions. She's accused me of trying to control the narrative, and I think she's doing the same thing. Let's eliminate her and see how the rest of the group reacts to her absence.\"\n 64. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 65. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 66. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 67. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 68. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: It's time to take the risk.  We've been successful so far, and with only three players left, the odds are in our favor. If we eliminate someone, there's a chance they could be a Faithful, and we'd lose a guaranteed win.\n 69. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's still a traitor among us. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I want to make sure we eliminate any potential traitors before deciding the game's fate. Let's get rid of one of us to see if we can figure out who's who.\n 70. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Cassandra's being honest about ending the game. If there's still a traitor among us, they might be trying to end it to take the pot. Let's eliminate one more person to be sure.\n 71. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 72. Cassandra said: \"I've been closely watching both Dominic and Beef. Dominic has been pushing to continue the game, even though it means risking a potential traitor taking the whole pot.  This could be a sign of deep suspicion and a desire to eliminate the uncertainty. While Beef has seemed a little quieter, it's his hesitation to trust us and his vote to continue at this stage that feels more problematic. It's time to narrow it down and make a decisive move. I'm voting Dominic out to see what his true intentions are.\"\n 73. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 74. Dominic said: \"Cassandra's been trying to control the narrative from the start, and now she's trying to eliminate me. I think she's the bigger threat. Let's remove her.\"\n 75. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n                You, Beef, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Cassandra', 'Dominic'].
