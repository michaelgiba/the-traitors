Dominic suggests murdering Beef: Beef seems cautious and questions Cassandra's actions, which could make them harder to manipulate.

We need to stick together and it's clear Beef is starting to question our loyalties.\"\n 32. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 33. Dominic said: \"I think Cassandra's been pushing too hard to eliminate people without solid proof. Her actions seem suspicious, and I don't want to be controlled. Let's take a chance and remove her.\"\n 34. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 35. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra because her behavior has been too manipulative. She's pushing eliminations without solid proof, which makes me suspicious. Her actions could be trying to control the group or hide her true intentions. It's safer to remove her now to protect our group.\"\n 36. Braxton voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 37. Sudz said: \"After observing Braxton's behavior, I believe his sudden push to eliminate Cassandra without much evidence is too aggressive and manipulative. His actions seem more about controlling the group or hiding his true intentions rather than genuinely protecting us. I think it's safer for our group to remove him now to prevent any potential threats from within.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 39. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Cassandra because she's been too pushy and manipulative, and her actions seem suspicious. She's been quick to eliminate others without solid proof, and now Alessandra's gone. I don't want to follow her lead without questioning it, and I think it's safer to remove her to protect our group.\"\n 40. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 41. Cassandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Cassandra WAS a traitor\n 42. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 43. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 44. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm voting to continue playing because I think there's still a chance to eliminate the other traitor and secure a bigger share of the prize pool for myself. With Sudz and Beef left, I'm not sure who's faithful and who's not. If I vote to end the game now and there's a traitor among them, I'll get nothing. By continuing to play, I can try to gather more information and make a strategic move to increase my chances of winning.\n 45. Sudz votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Even though Sudz and Beef are left, there's still a chance to eliminate the last traitor. Continuing the game gives me an opportunity to gather more information and make a strategic move. If there's still a traitor among them, I risk ending up with nothing. However, if I manage to eliminate the last traitor, I'll secure a bigger share of the prize pool for myself.\n 46. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure who's a traitor yet, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if there's still a traitor among us. Continuing to play gives me a chance to figure out who's left and make a strategic move.\n 47. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 48. Dominic said: \"I've been playing this game trying to figure out who's trustworthy and who's not. Sudz, your decisions have seemed a bit too convenient at times, and I think it's time we take a closer look. With only two of you left, I'm choosing to err on the side of caution and vote you out to ensure the traitor doesn't win.\"\n 49. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 50. Sudz said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His behavior has been quite suspicious, and his sudden push to continue playing without considering the potential consequences shows a level of recklessness. I don't want to risk everything we have left just to follow his lead. With the stakes as high as they are, it's better to err on the side of caution.\"\n 51.
