You seemed pretty sure about eliminating them. What made you decide to vote that way?'\n 35. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I noticed how you jumped to conclusions about Taylor. I mean, it's always good to be cautious, but sometimes accusations can be a bit misleading, don't you think? I voted for Morgan because I felt their sudden move against Taylor was a bit too quick without solid proof. It's important to consider the reasons behind someone's actions before making decisions, especially in a game like this.\"\n 36. Riley messaged Parker: \"Parker, your response seems a bit defensive about your vote on Morgan. I'm just trying to understand your thought process. Can you tell me more about what specifically made you think Morgan's action was too quick?\"\n 37. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I appreciate your curiosity.

Trust can be earned, but it's important to be mindful of everyone's actions and motives. I'm here to work together and figure out the truth.\"\n 43. Riley messaged Parker: \"Parker, I appreciate your caution, but I need to know if I can trust you. Can you tell me honestly, do you have any reason to believe I'm a Traitor?\"\n 44.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Parker\n 54. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because she was suspicious of me from the start and didn't give me a clear reason why.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 66. Casey said: \"Gwendolyn's been suspicious of me from the start without a clear reason.

I'd rather take the chance that we've eliminated all traitors and split the pot now.\n 72. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We can't be certain we've caught all the traitors yet.

Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I've seen some questionable behavior from some players, but it's been mainly manipulation to deflect attention from themselves. Taylor and Casey were eliminated early, which makes me believe there might be only one or two traitors left.

Gwendolyn messaged Parker: \"I'm glad you're on the up and up, Parker. I've been trying to read the room. Do you think we have any traitors in our group?\"\n 5. Parker messaged Gwendolyn: \"Casey, Fletcher, and Riley all seem a bit too defensive to me. I've noticed that too. Taylor seems like a nice person, but then again, appearances can be deceiving.\"\n 6. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I'm Casey. I'm feeling pretty suspicious about Parker. What's your take on them?\"\n 7. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: \"Honestly, Casey, I'm getting the same vibes from you. Too defensive and a bit rehearsed in your response. I'm keeping an open mind though.\"\n 8. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Fair enough, I guess I was a bit guarded. I'm just trying to figure out who's a traitor.

It feels like a move to eliminate a Faithful, which makes me question if Taylor might be a Traitor.\"\n 12. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 13. Riley said: \"Taylor just called my name out of nowhere. I think they're trying to throw us off. Morgan brought up a good point, Taylor's sudden accusation against me feels like a tactic. I'd rather take a chance on eliminating Taylor and seeing if that helps clear up who's a Traitor.\"\n 14. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 15. Parker said: \"Friends, I have observed Morgan's behavior closely during this game. They initially seemed trustworthy, but their recent vote against Taylor without substantial reasoning raises doubts. Morgan's actions align with traitor tendencies to manipulate outcomes.

I think Taylor's sudden accusation against Riley is a bit too convenient. This move seems like a distraction. I\u2019m voting for Taylor.\"\n 18. Fletcher voted to eliminate Taylor\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"Parker, your initial message seemed too cooperative, and it made me suspicious. Your vote against Morgan didn't convince me, but it was your initial message that raised my red flag.

Parker said: \"I've noticed Morgan's behavior in this game is a bit concerning. Morgan's accusation against Taylor seemed sudden and lacked substantial evidence. I believe they might be trying to manipulate the outcomes and that their actions align more with a traitor's behavior. So, my vote is to eliminate Morgan.\"\n 29.

Their sudden accusations and lack of solid evidence make me question their loyalty. I think we need to take a closer look at Parker's actions and eliminate them to protect the Faithful.\"\n 33. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Parker\n 34. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because she was suspicious of me from the start and didn't give me a clear reason why.

Parker was BANISHED with 4 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm a bit confused. We just eliminated Parker and now it's only you, Riley, and Casey left. I'm not sure who I can trust anymore.\"\n 38. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: \"Casey, your behavior has been really inconsistent. At first, you were defensive of yourself, but then you went after me and seemed to be pushing for Parker's elimination. What's your real intention?\"\n 39. Morgan messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I'm getting a bit worried about Casey. Their reasons for voting didn't seem that strong, and I'm starting to think they might be a traitor. What's your take on it?\"\n 40. Morgan said: \"I'm voting out Casey because their reasons for eliminating Gwendolyn were unclear and seemed more like a tactic to remove a Faithful. This behavior makes me suspect Casey could be a traitor trying to manipulate the game.\"\n 41. Morgan voted to eliminate Casey\n 42. Riley said: \"Casey's votes have seemed unclear to me. They eliminated Gwendolyn without a solid reason, and now Morgan's suspicions about Casey are making me think they might be a Traitor. I'd rather be safe and vote out Casey.\"\n 43. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 44. Fletcher said: \"Hey everyone, I've been watching Casey's actions closely. They've eliminated Gwendolyn without clear reasoning and have suggested Gwendolyn may be a traitor without solid evidence. This kind of behavior doesn't sit right with me. I think Casey is the one we should be looking at more closely and I'm voting to eliminate Casey.\"\n 45. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 46. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher, I've been paying close attention to your votes and your logic. Your reasoning seems solid, but I've noticed that you've been trying to keep Casey in the game despite their questionable behavior. I think this is a red flag, and I'm worried that you might be trying to protect a potential traitor. I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher to protect the Faithful.\"\n 47. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 48. Casey said: \"Gwendolyn's been suspicious of me from the start without a clear reason.

Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't think we can be sure all traitors are gone. Let's eliminate another player to be safe.\n 53. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. We've lost a few players, and I'm not convinced there are still traitors among us. If there's even one traitor left, they win and we get nothing. I'd rather take the chance that we've eliminated all traitors and split the pot now.\n 54. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We can't be certain we've caught all the traitors yet. It's safer to eliminate one more person to increase our chances of winning the prize pool evenly.\n 55. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I've seen some questionable behavior from some players, but it's been mainly manipulation to deflect attention from themselves. Taylor and Casey were eliminated early, which makes me believe there might be only one or two traitors left. Parker was eliminated when it seemed like they were innocent, and now it's down to four of us. I'm choosing to end the game, hoping that we've caught all the traitors and can split the pot evenly.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue.
