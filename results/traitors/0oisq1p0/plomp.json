Parker suggests murdering Riley: Riley's voting behavior seemed to be heavily influenced by others, as seen when Gwendolyn voted against them following Casey's accusation of random attacks. This suggests a lack of independent decision-making which is a characteristic often exploited by traitors. Additionally, the fact that Parker had suggested Riley as a target for elimination indicates that they are already under suspicion from other players and may have been identified as a threat by the traitors, making Riley a likely target for the betrayer's next move.\n 29.
