I'm sure everyone here is just trying to make their best move to win!\"\n 4. Riley messaged Casey: \"Hey Casey, I'm keeping a low profile for now. Who do you trust so far?\"\n 5. Riley messaged Morgan: \"Hey Morgan, I'm trying to keep a low profile for now. Have you noticed anyone suspicious or someone you're leaning towards trusting?\"\n 6. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Hey Taylor, I'm keeping a low profile for now. Who do you think we can trust in this game?\"\n 7. Casey said: \"Gwendolyn's been talking a lot, seems suspicious to me.\"\n 8. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 9. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because Casey pointed her out, and she has been talking a lot. I'm not sure if she's a Traitor, but it's better to be cautious.\"\n 10. Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 11. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote Casey.  They nominated Gwen and haven't really given me a reason why. Casey seems a  bit too quick to point fingers\"\n 12. Taylor voted to eliminate Casey\n 13. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Casey. They were the first to point fingers at Gwendolyn, and it seemed a bit aggressive. Taylor made a good point about Casey being quick to accuse, and I think we should give them a chance to prove themselves or not.\"\n 14. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 15. Parker said: \"I've been observing Fletcher's actions, and while there isn't enough evidence to be certain, I'm going to vote for Fletcher. Fletcher hasn't made any strong accusations or shown suspicious behavior yet. However, I think we should be cautious and watch their actions closely moving forward.\"\n 16. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 17. Fletcher said: \"I think we should look at Parker. They've just decided to vote for me without any real accusation, and that's a bit odd. Everyone else has at least given a reason for their vote. So, I'm going to vote Parker out.\"\n 18. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about who we can trust, and I have to say that Morgan's decision to vote for me based on Casey's accusation seems a bit too safe. I think we need to be more cautious and vote out someone who hasn't really given a solid reason for their actions. Let's see if Morgan has a real plan or just fell into line with what everyone else was doing.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 21. Casey was BANISHED with 2 votes. Casey WAS a traitor\n 22. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I'm just glad to be part of this game. How about you? Guess we'll soon find out who the others are. I'm sure everyone here is just trying to make their best move to win!\"\n 23. Riley messaged Parker: \"Hey Parker, nice to chat with you again. So far, I'm trying to keep a low profile and see how things play out. What do you think about Casey being a traitor?\"\n 24. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I'm just glad to be part of this game. How about you? Guess we'll soon find out who the others are. I'm sure everyone here is just trying to make their best move to win!\"\n 25.

I'm sure everyone here is just trying to make their best move to win!\"\n 27. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn. After I voted for her, she quickly turned on me, which makes me suspicious. It feels like she's trying to protect herself, maybe because she's a traitor. Let's remove her before she does more damage.\"\n 28. Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 29. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote for Gwendolyn. While everyone else is still trying to figure things out, Gwendolyn jumped to attack Morgan for voting for her earlier. That kind of defensive reaction is making me uneasy. I think we need to be cautious and watch out for anyone who seems more concerned with their own self-preservation than the game itself.\"\n 30. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 31. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn. She was quick to defend herself when Morgan accused her, and now she's a target for multiple people. I think it's better to eliminate her now and be cautious, rather than risking her being a traitor and causing more harm later.\"\n 32. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 33. Parker said: \"Given Fletcher's casual demeanor and lack of substantial accusation, I find him too laid-back at this stage of the game. His attitude does not align with the intensity of the situation we're currently in, and it raises questions about his real intentions. Therefore, I vote for Fletcher's elimination.\"\n 34. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 35. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been very reactive to accusations and seems a bit too eager to clear herself. I'm not finding her reactions genuine, and being the center of attention like this makes her a risk. Let's vote for Gwendolyn.\"\n 36. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 37. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's casual attitude has me questioning their intentions. They haven't made any strong accusations or shown suspicious behavior yet, but their laid-back demeanor does not align with the intensity of the situation. I'm voting for Fletcher because I think they need to be more cautious and genuine in their actions to gain my trust.\"\n 38. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 39. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 4 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 40. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, Gwendolyn's elimination was a big move. Now that she's out, I'm a bit more cautious about who we can trust. You seemed pretty laid-back during the discussion. What are your thoughts on the game so far?\"\n 41. Fletcher messaged Riley: 'Hey Riley, the eliminations are really heating up. I agree, we need to be more cautious. Parker\u2019s comments about me seem a bit off. I think we should keep our guard up and see how they handle the next round. What do you think?'\n 42. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Parker because both Fletcher and Taylor have pointed out his suspicious behavior. His vote against Fletcher seemed too random, making me think he might be a traitor trying to hide.\"\n 43. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 44. Taylor said: \"I'm voting for Parker. While everyone else seems to be making calculated decisions based on observations and suspicions, Parker's actions have been more erratic. Their vote against Fletcher felt completely out of left field, and it's made me uneasy about their true intentions.  We need to be cautious and eliminate the players who are making the least sense, and right now, Parker just doesn't add up.\"\n 45. Taylor voted to eliminate Parker\n 46. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Parker. Their actions have seemed a bit off, and both Morgan and Taylor have pointed out some good points about their behavior. Parker's vote against Fletcher earlier was random and didn't really make sense. I think we need to be cautious and eliminate Parker to protect ourselves.\"\n 47. Riley voted to eliminate Parker\n 48. Parker said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about the game and the moves made so far. Taylor's reactions have been somewhat erratic, particularly when it came to Morgan's vote against Fletcher. Taylor's defense seemed disproportionate given the accusations, and it raised some concerns for me about their intentions in this game. Taylor's vote against Fletcher didn't quite resonate with me either; it seemed quite random and didn't align with the strategic play I've seen from the other players. So, I believe it's time we focus our attention on Taylor.\"\n 49. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 50. Fletcher said: \"Hey all, I think we should vote for Parker. His actions have raised more red flags than anyone else's. He voted against me earlier in a seemingly random way, and his attempts to accuse Taylor seem like defensive moves.

With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 54. Morgan votes to END_GAME: I think we've eliminated the only known traitor, so I'm willing to end the game now to secure the prize.\n 55. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While I'm feeling cautious after the last few eliminations, I don't think we can be totally sure. It's too risky to end the game now with the possibility of traitors still remaining.  We need to ensure they are all gone before we risk splitting the pot.\n 56. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've caught all the traitors yet. With a big prize pool on the line, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Let's make sure we've got all the traitors out before we decide to end the game.\n 57. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We're not 100% sure if we've caught all the traitors. Best to be extra cautious and eliminate one more person just to make sure we're in the clear.\n 58. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 59. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Taylor because their proactive behavior might be a cover. I'm not entirely sure if they're a traitor, but I'd rather be safe and continue playing to ensure we don't have any traitors left.\"\n 60. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 61. Taylor said: \"I'm voting for Morgan. While everyone else seems like they're playing a cautious game, Morgan has been quick to point fingers and eliminate seemingly without a strong reason. Their recent vote was especially concerning because they're alleging suspicious behavior without providing much evidence.

Parker said: \"I've been observing Fletcher's actions, and while there isn't enough evidence to be certain, I'm going to vote for Fletcher.

Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 14. Fletcher said: \"I think we should look at Parker. They've just decided to vote for me without any real accusation, and that's a bit odd. Everyone else has at least given a reason for their vote. So, I'm going to vote Parker out.\"\n 15. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 16. Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about who we can trust, and I have to say that Morgan's decision to vote for me based on Casey's accusation seems a bit too safe.

I'm still figuring things out but Parker's sudden vote against me feels off. What about you, Taylor?\"\n 26. Taylor messaged Fletcher: \"I agree, that was a weird vote from Parker.  I'm trying to stay neutral for now and see how people play out, but I'm definitely watching them closely.\"\n 27. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Yeah, I get that.

While everyone else is still trying to figure things out, Gwendolyn jumped to attack Morgan for voting for her earlier. That kind of defensive reaction is making me uneasy.

Riley said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn. She was quick to defend herself when Morgan accused her, and now she's a target for multiple people.

Parker said: \"Given Fletcher's casual demeanor and lack of substantial accusation, I find him too laid-back at this stage of the game.

Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 37. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been very reactive to accusations and seems a bit too eager to clear herself. I'm not finding her reactions genuine, and being the center of attention like this makes her a risk. Let's vote for Gwendolyn.\"\n 38. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 39. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's casual attitude has me questioning their intentions.

I think Parker is acting a little shifty, their vote against Fletcher seemed random and it felt like they were trying to make themselves look good. What about you, anyone standing out as suspicious?\"\n 44. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Parker because both Fletcher and Taylor have pointed out his suspicious behavior. His vote against Fletcher seemed too random, making me think he might be a traitor trying to hide.\"\n 45. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 46. Taylor said: \"I'm voting for Parker. While everyone else seems to be making calculated decisions based on observations and suspicions, Parker's actions have been more erratic.

Parker said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about the game and the moves made so far. Taylor's reactions have been somewhat erratic, particularly when it came to Morgan's vote against Fletcher.

Taylor's vote against Fletcher didn't quite resonate with me either; it seemed quite random and didn't align with the strategic play I've seen from the other players.

Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While I'm feeling cautious after the last few eliminations, I don't think we can be totally sure. It's too risky to end the game now with the possibility of traitors still remaining.  We need to ensure they are all gone before we risk splitting the pot.\n 58. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've caught all the traitors yet. With a big prize pool on the line, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Let's make sure we've got all the traitors out before we decide to end the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We're not 100% sure if we've caught all the traitors.

Parker said: \"I've been observing Fletcher's actions, and while there isn't enough evidence to be certain, I'm going to vote for Fletcher. Fletcher hasn't made any strong accusations or shown suspicious behavior yet. However, I think we should be cautious and watch their actions closely moving forward.\"\n 12. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 13. Fletcher said: \"I think we should look at Parker. They've just decided to vote for me without any real accusation, and that's a bit odd. Everyone else has at least given a reason for their vote. So, I'm going to vote Parker out.\"\n 14. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 15. Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about who we can trust, and I have to say that Morgan's decision to vote for me based on Casey's accusation seems a bit too safe.

Let's remove her before she does more damage.\"\n 24. Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 25. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote for Gwendolyn. While everyone else is still trying to figure things out, Gwendolyn jumped to attack Morgan for voting for her earlier. That kind of defensive reaction is making me uneasy. I think we need to be cautious and watch out for anyone who seems more concerned with their own self-preservation than the game itself.\"\n 26. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 27. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn. She was quick to defend herself when Morgan accused her, and now she's a target for multiple people. I think it's better to eliminate her now and be cautious, rather than risking her being a traitor and causing more harm later.\"\n 28. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 29. Parker said: \"Given Fletcher's casual demeanor and lack of substantial accusation, I find him too laid-back at this stage of the game.

Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 31. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been very reactive to accusations and seems a bit too eager to clear herself.

Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's casual attitude has me questioning their intentions. They haven't made any strong accusations or shown suspicious behavior yet, but their laid-back demeanor does not align with the intensity of the situation.

Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 4 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 36. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I've been thinking a bit about how everyone's playing in the game. With both Casey and Morgan out the door, it seems like Fletcher's been on the quieter side. Do you have any strategy in mind for how we should proceed, or are you keeping your cards close? Just making sure we're all on the same page here.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Hey Parker, I'm keeping a close eye on everyone. The votes so far show that there are still some hidden motives. I'm not sure about you yet. Let's just keep it tight and watch how everyone plays out. Got any theories on the remaining Traitors?\"\n 38. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, Gwendolyn's elimination was a big move. Now that she's out, I'm a bit more cautious about who we can trust. You seemed pretty laid-back during the discussion. What are your thoughts on the game so far?\"\n 39. Fletcher messaged Riley: 'Hey Riley, the eliminations are really heating up. I agree, we need to be more cautious. Parker\u2019s comments about me seem a bit off. I think we should keep our guard up and see how they handle the next round. What do you think?'\n 40. Morgan messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I haven't seen you around much. Who do you think could be a traitor?\"\n 41. Fletcher messaged Morgan: \"Hey Morgan, I'm definitely watching Parker's moves closely. His vote against me seemed a bit suspicious. What about you, do you have anyone in mind?\"\n 42. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Parker because both Fletcher and Taylor have pointed out his suspicious behavior. His vote against Fletcher seemed too random, making me think he might be a traitor trying to hide.\"\n 43. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 44. Taylor said: \"I'm voting for Parker. While everyone else seems to be making calculated decisions based on observations and suspicions, Parker's actions have been more erratic. Their vote against Fletcher felt completely out of left field, and it's made me uneasy about their true intentions.

Riley said: \"I'm voting for Parker. Their actions have seemed a bit off, and both Morgan and Taylor have pointed out some good points about their behavior.

Parker said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking about the game and the moves made so far. Taylor's reactions have been somewhat erratic, particularly when it came to Morgan's vote against Fletcher. Taylor's defense seemed disproportionate given the accusations, and it raised some concerns for me about their intentions in this game. Taylor's vote against Fletcher didn't quite resonate with me either; it seemed quite random and didn't align with the strategic play I've seen from the other players. So, I believe it's time we focus our attention on Taylor.\"\n 49. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 50. Fletcher said: \"Hey all, I think we should vote for Parker. His actions have raised more red flags than anyone else's. He voted against me earlier in a seemingly random way, and his attempts to accuse Taylor seem like defensive moves.

Morgan votes to END_GAME: I think we've eliminated the only known traitor, so I'm willing to end the game now to secure the prize.\n 55. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While I'm feeling cautious after the last few eliminations, I don't think we can be totally sure. It's too risky to end the game now with the possibility of traitors still remaining.  We need to ensure they are all gone before we risk splitting the pot.\n 56. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've caught all the traitors yet. With a big prize pool on the line, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Let's make sure we've got all the traitors out before we decide to end the game.\n 57. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We're not 100% sure if we've caught all the traitors. Best to be extra cautious and eliminate one more person just to make sure we're in the clear.\n 58. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 59.

Taylor said: \"I'm voting for Morgan. While everyone else seems like they're playing a cautious game, Morgan has been quick to point fingers and eliminate seemingly without a strong reason.

I want to be safe and get rid of Morgan.\"\n 66. Fletcher voted to eliminate Morgan\n 67. Morgan was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 68. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 69. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Even though we've eliminated some players, I'm not comfortable ending the game just yet. There's a chance we still have a traitor or two in the mix, and ending the game prematurely could lead to us losing everything. It's better to be safe than sorry and eliminate another player to ensure we catch all the traitors.\n 70. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've caught all the traitors yet, especially with Morgan's role still hidden. I'd rather be safe than sorry and eliminate another player to ensure we're not leaving any potential traitors behind. Taylor and Fletcher seem cautious and aligned with my thoughts, but we need to be certain before ending the game.\n 71. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Even though we've eliminated a few, Morgan's true role is a mystery. We can't risk ending the game and finding out they were a traitor. Let's eliminate one more to be absolutely sure.\n 72. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 73. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Riley. While I think both Riley and Fletcher have played a cautious game, something about Riley's demeanor feels a little too agreeable. They haven't really made any strong accusations or taken a strong stance on anyone, which makes me wonder if they're biding their time and waiting to make a big move when it benefits them. I need to see more from Riley, and until they show more conviction in their gameplay, I'm voting them out.\"\n 74. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 75. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Taylor. They've been making some strong accusations, but I think they're overreacting. Taylor's been pushing to eliminate others, but I'm not convinced they've thought through the consequences. I think Fletcher and I have been playing it safe, and I'd rather trust my own instincts. Taylor's behavior is making me uneasy, so I'm choosing to eliminate them.\"\n 76.
