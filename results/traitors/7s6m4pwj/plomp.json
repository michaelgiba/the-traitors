Taking her out will isolate Gwendolyn and make her more vulnerable to manipulation.\n 84. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 85. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 86. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 87. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: We're in the final round, the risk of revealing ourselves is too high. It's better to gamble on splitting the pot now while we still have the advantage.\n 88. Beef votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because we have a good chance of winning the pot. If we continue playing, there's a risk that the faithful will figure out I'm a traitor and eliminate me. By ending the game now, I can secure my share of the pot.\n 89. Gwendolyn votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should continue playing to try and eliminate the remaining traitors. With only 3 players left, it's a lower risk of revealing ourselves, and we might have a better chance of taking out the traitors in the next round.

Beef suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher's been too suspicious and has already exposed a traitor, so he's a major threat to us traitors.\n 70. Cassandra votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is becoming too much of a threat. He's already shown he can identify traitors and is vocal about his suspicions.

We need someone proactive in this game, and I think Sudz might be playing a little too cautiously. I'm trusting my gut on this one.\"\n 80. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 81. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because his vote on Ellis was too quick and felt suspicious.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 89. Sudz was BANISHED with 4 votes. Sudz WAS NOT a traitor\n 90. Cassandra suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been vocal and seems to trust Gwendolyn.

Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because I think he's trying to stir up drama and distract us from his own suspicious behavior. His sudden vote against Ellis seemed too convenient, and now he's trying to frame Fletcher as the traitor. I don't think we can trust him.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 21. Braxton was BANISHED with 6 votes. Braxton WAS a traitor\n 22. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 23. Beef messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I've been thinking about Sudz's vote on Ellis, it seemed pretty quick. What are your thoughts on him now?\"\n 24. Gwendolyn messaged Beef: \"I agree, Sudz's move on Ellis did feel quick and suspicious. I'm still on the fence about him, but I'm starting to think he might be a traitor. We should keep an eye on him and be cautious of his next move.\"\n 25. Beef messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm still on the fence about Sudz, his vote on Ellis was shady. What made you think he's a traitor?\"\n 26. Gwendolyn messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, I'm still not 100% sure about Sudz, but his vote on Ellis felt super rushed and his behavior seems suspicious. I think we should keep an eye on him and see how he reacts next.\"\n 27. Beef messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm still on the fence about Sudz, his vote on Ellis was shady. Let's keep an eye on him and see if he's working with anyone else.\"\n 28. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been playing a little too close to the vest and I'm starting to get suspicious. He's dropped hints about Beef and Braxton, but I'm not sure if those were genuine observations or subtle attempts to manipulate us.

Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 34. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Cassandra because her sudden suspicion towards me feels off. She's been trying to manipulate the conversation and turn the group against me. I think she's trying to deflect attention from her own behavior.\"\n 35. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 36. Sudz said: \"I've had my suspicions about Dominic. His defensive stance and sudden accusations against others, like his claims against Cassandra and even me, don't add up. He seems more focused on playing the blame game rather than contributing to our strategies. I believe he has been trying to manipulate the conversation and divert our attention from his own suspicious behavior. I think it's time we expose Dominic and see what he's made of.\"\n 37. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 38. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic. His behavior has been pretty shady, constantly shifting his alliances and his vote back against Cassandra seemed really defensive. He's putting up a smokescreen, and I think now is the time to clear the fog.\"\n 39. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because his behavior has been super inconsistent and manipulative. He's constantly shifting his alliances and making accusations for no reason.

I think it's time we expose him and see what he's really made of.\"\n 41. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 43.

Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I noticed Sudz's behavior early on was a bit suspicious, especially his quick vote against Ellis. Also, after we exposed Dominic, I think Fletcher's murder is a huge red flag and we need to figure out who's behind it. We really need to keep an eye on Sudz and see if he's working with the traitors.\"\n 46. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I'm really suspicious of Sudz too. His flip on Ellis, who was faithful, feels like classic traitor behavior. What do you think about Fletcher being murdered? Do you think Sudz is a traitor? We need to figure out our next move carefully.\"\n 47. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm with you, Alessandra. Fletcher's murder is a huge red flag. Sudz's behavior has been suspicious from the start, especially his quick flip on Ellis. I think we need to keep a close eye on him and figure out if he's working with the traitors. We should also discuss potential moves to take out the remaining traitors. What are your thoughts?\"\n 48. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I'm really suspicious of Sudz too. His flip on Ellis, who was faithful, feels like classic traitor behavior. Fletcher's murder is a huge red flag. Let's try to quietly get others on board to take Sudz out next round. Keep an eye on Cassandra as well, just in case.\"\n 49. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. While he seems like a genuine person, I feel like he's been too quiet and observant, sitting back and letting others make the moves. Sometimes too much observation can signal suspicion. We need someone proactive in this game, and I think Sudz might be playing a little too cautiously. I'm trusting my gut on this one.\"\n 50. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 51. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because his vote on Ellis was too quick and felt suspicious.

Alessandra said: \"I'm voting Sudz because his quick flip on Ellis, who was faithful, feels like classic traitor behavior. His actions have been too suspicious, and I think it's time we take him out.\"\n 54. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 55. Sudz said: \"I've observed Cassandra's behavior closely, and I have my reservations. Her accusations, especially towards Dominic, seemed defensive. She has a tendency to manipulate conversations to her advantage. In light of this, I believe it would be best for the group to eliminate Cassandra for the time being.\"\n 56. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 57. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because his behavior has been inconsistent and suspicious, especially his quick flip on Ellis and his recent accusations against Cassandra. I think it's time we take a closer look at him and see if he's working with the traitors. His vote to eliminate Cassandra feels like another attempt to distract us from his own behavior, so I'm choosing to believe Cassandra's instincts on this one.\"\n 58. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 59. Sudz was BANISHED with 4 votes. Sudz WAS NOT a traitor\n 60. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 61. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 62. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: We're in the final round, the risk of revealing ourselves is too high. It's better to gamble on splitting the pot now while we still have the advantage.\n 63. Beef votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because we have a good chance of winning the pot. If we continue playing, there's a risk that the faithful will figure out I'm a traitor and eliminate me. By ending the game now, I can secure my share of the pot.\n 64. Gwendolyn votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should continue playing to try and eliminate the remaining traitors. With only 3 players left, it's a lower risk of revealing ourselves, and we might have a better chance of taking out the traitors in the next round. Splitting the pot now seems too high of a risk to me.\n 65. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 66. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn, while it's been an interesting game, I believe it's time for you to go.  We've been circling each other for a while now, and I can sense some duplicity beneath your outward politeness.  I wouldn't trust you with a hundred dollars, let alone a half a million.  You've been playing too conservatively, whispering in the shadows and trying to ride the coattails of others. It's time to see if you're truly on our side, or if you're hiding something. Vote Gwendolyn out. It's the only logical choice.\"\n 67. Cassandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 68. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because she's been playing it too safe and hasn't shown her true colors yet. Cassandra's been more vocal and suspicious, but I think Gwendolyn's conservativeness is a bigger red flag for me. Let's take out Gwendolyn and see what's going on.\"\n 69.
