'Dominic' selected as a traitor.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Alessandra', 'Beef', 'Braxton', 'Cassandra', 'Dominic', 'Ellis', 'Sudz']\n 3. Braxton said: \"I've been keeping a close eye on Sudz. Their behavior has been a bit too eager and inconsistent, which makes me suspicious. I believe Sudz might be hiding something, and for the sake of the group, I'm voting to eliminate Sudz.\"\n 4. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 5. Dominic said: \"I'm on the same page as Braxton here. Sudz's behavior does seem a bit off, and I think it's worth investigating further. For now, I'm voting to eliminate Sudz.\"\n 6. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 7. Alessandra said: \"I trust Sudz after their message, but Braxton and Dominic's points make me doubt. Better safe than sorry, so I vote Sudz.\"\n 8. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 9. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to have to agree with Braxton and Dominic. Something just feels off about Sudz's demeanor.  I think we need to take a gamble and see what's going on.\"\n 10. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 11. Ellis said: \"Alright, I'm seeing a lot of consistent red flags about Sudz from multiple people. If they\u2019re a Traitor, we need to act fast. But even if they\u2019re not, maybe their behavior just isn\u2019t a risk worth keeping around. I\u2019ll vote Sudz too.\"\n 12. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Sudz said: \"Hello everyone, I've noticed that Braxton has been quite insistent on their suspicions and seems to be spreading mistrust. Their behavior appears manipulative and self-serving. I believe Braxton's actions are against the interests of the group. I vote to eliminate Braxton.\"\n 14. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 15. Beef said: \"Braxton's accusations against Sudz seem too convenient, I'm voting to eliminate Braxton.\"\n 16. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 17. Sudz was BANISHED with 5 votes. Sudz WAS NOT a traitor\n 18. Braxton suggests murdering Beef: Beef is seen as a strategic player who could pose a threat to the traitors' objectives. His behavior indicates he might be suspicious of the traitors' actions, making him a high-risk target for elimination to protect the team's interests.\n 19. Dominic suggests murdering Beef: Beef seems to be a strategic player and is suspicious of our actions. If he's not eliminated, he could expose us later. Braxton already suggested getting rid of him, and I agree it's a good move to protect our interests.\n 20. Braxton votes to murder Beef: Beef is a strategic threat who could expose our plans. Eliminating him protects our interests and maintains control over the game dynamics.\n 21. Dominic votes to murder Beef: Beef is a strategic threat, suspicious of our actions, and could expose us later if not eliminated. Unanimous decision with Braxton to protect our interests.\n 22. The traitors have decided to murder Beef\n 23. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 24. Ellis messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, I'm thinkin' Braxton's shady. He pushed so hard to get Sudz out, then Beef gets murdered after backin' him. Maybe he's the real Traitor. We need to watch him close.\"\n 25. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I see where you're coming from with Braxton, but let's not jump to conclusions. We need to gather more info before making any moves. For now, let's keep this between us and see how Braxton plays out. What do you think about Cassandra and Alessandra? They seem pretty loyal.\"\n 26. Ellis messaged Dominic: \"Dom, Braxton's too loud. Sudz\u2019s gone, Beef\u2019s dead\u2014coincidence or play? His aggression could be covering his tracks. Let\u2019s watch him but test if Cass or Alessandra shift if we fake doubt. Stay tight.\"\n 27. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I agree Braxton's being loud, but let's not forget we're the ones who decided to take out Beef. We need to be careful not to draw attention to ourselves. Testing Cass and Alessandra is a good idea, but we should be subtle. What if we start spreading some doubt about Braxton, see how they react?\"\n 28. Ellis messaged Dominic: \"Dom, let's fake doubt about Braxton\u2019s motives. The real traitors\u2019ll stick by him. Keep tabs on Cass and Alex\u2014if they side fiercely, they\u2019re either in or spooked. Beef\u2019s death after Sudz? Braxton\u2019s the thread. Let\u2019s see who tugs with him.\"\n 29. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, let's start spreading doubt about Braxton's motives. See how Cass and Alessandra react. If they stick by him, they might be in or spooked. Keep it subtle, we don't want to raise suspicion on ourselves.\"\n 30. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Cassandra's behavior has been a bit off. She's been too quick to trust and not paying attention to the real threats. For the safety of the group, I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra.\"\n 31. Braxton voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 32. Dominic said: \"Braxton's been pushing hard to eliminate others, but his own actions seem suspicious. He's been too loud and aggressive, it's like he's trying to distract us from something. I think we should take a closer look at him before it's too late.\"\n 33. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 34. Alessandra said: \"I think Braxton's behavior has been really manipulative, especially how he's been pushing hard to eliminate others quickly. I'm worried he might be hiding something, so I'm voting to eliminate Braxton to keep us safer.\"\n 35. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 36. Cassandra said: \"I can't ignore the pattern here. Braxton's been very aggressive in pushing for eliminations and directing suspicion. It feels too calculated and I think he's trying to throw us off his trail.  We need to clean house and cut that manipulative energy.\"\n 37. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 38. Ellis said: 'Braxton\u2019s desperation to frame others distracts from his own red flags. He\u2019s been calling all the shots, pushing Sudz out then Beef ended up dead after backing him. Let\u2019s cut the puppet master before more fall like flies.'\n 39. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 40. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS a traitor\n 41. Dominic suggests murdering Ellis: Ellis seems to be gaining traction and is starting to suspect Braxton, who we just found out was a traitor. Ellis's messages to me have shown they're willing to think critically and gather information. If we don't take them out, they might start to uncover our identities. Cassandra and Alessandra seem more trusting and less likely to suspect us at this point, making Ellis the bigger threat.\n 42. Dominic votes to murder Ellis: Ellis is gaining traction and suspects Braxton, who's now known to be a traitor. If we don't eliminate Ellis, they might uncover our identities. Cassandra and Alessandra seem less likely to suspect us, making Ellis the bigger threat.\n 43. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 44. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 45. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 46. Dominic votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. With only three players left, including myself and another traitor, I believe our chances of winning are high. If we all vote to end the game, we'll split the $500,000. Since there's a chance that Cassandra or Alessandra might suspect me or my fellow traitor, it's safer to end the game now and secure our win rather than risk being discovered and getting nothing.\n 47. Alessandra votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't think we should end the game yet because there might still be a traitor among us. Dominic's push to end the game makes me suspicious. Let's keep playing to see if we can uncover any remaining traitors.\n 48. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: While I trust my instincts, the risk of being outplayed by an unseen traitor is too high. Dominic's sudden push for the end game makes me uneasy, but I'm uncertain Alessandra or Dominic would risk it all by betraying our trust.  The potential reward is too great to pass up, even with a slight risk.\n 49. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n                You, Dominic, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Alessandra', 'Cassandra'].
