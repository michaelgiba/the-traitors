Casey said: \"I'm voting for Morgan because they've been acting shady, whispering to me and others, and always seeming to have an angle. It's raising my suspicions.\"\n 25. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 26. Parker was BANISHED with 5 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 27. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm glad we got rid of Parker, but now Morgan's gone too. I'm getting a little worried about Casey, they seem to be whispering a lot. What do you think about their behavior?\"\n 29. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Yeah, I've noticed Casey's been pretty whispery. Gwendolyn also got suspicious of Casey earlier. We need to focus on Casey in the next round table for sure.\"\n 30. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I think we should bring up Casey in the next round table. Their whispers are raising red flags. What if they're a traitor trying to manipulate us?\"\n 31. Casey messaged Riley: \"Riley, I'm getting a bad vibe from Gwendolyn, she's been quick to point fingers and got Parker banished, and now Fletcher is watching us. What's your take on Gwendolyn and Fletcher?\"\n 32. Riley messaged Casey: \"Casey, I'm getting a vibe that you might be trying to shift the attention away from yourself. I've noticed you've been whispering a lot, and now you're pointing fingers at Gwendolyn and Fletcher? I'm not sure I trust you completely. What's your real strategy here?\"\n 33. Casey messaged Riley: \"Riley, I'm not trying to shift attention away from myself, I'm just observing the same things you are. Gwendolyn was quick to eliminate Parker and now Fletcher is watching us. We need to be careful and figure out who the traitors are before it's too late.\"\n 34. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Riley, let's steer clear of Gwendolyn for now. She's a bit too trigger-happy with her accusations. Casey's whispering is still a big red flag for me.\"\n 35. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree with you on Gwendolyn, she's a bit too eager to accuse. But Casey's whispering is still super suspicious. What if we try to get more info out of Gwendolyn without making her feel targeted?\"\n 36. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Yeah, let's be subtle with Gwendolyn. We should focus on Casey, see if we can catch something. Their whispers aren't adding up.\"\n 37. Gwendolyn said: \"I think we should eliminate Taylor for being too trusting. They tend to agree with others too quickly and haven't shown much skepticism, which makes me wonder if they're genuinely aligned with us or just trying to fit in.\"\n 38. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 39. Taylor said: \"Gwendolyn's been pushing hard to get rid of people, and even though her targets have made some questionable moves, I'm starting to feel like she's playing a manipulative game. I think she's trying to make allies by targeting other players, and her latest suggestion about me feels like a backhanded attack.  We need to be careful about who we trust, and I feel like Gwendolyn's playing a little too risky.\"\n 40. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 41. Riley said: \"Casey's been whispering a lot and their stories don't add up. I'm suspicious of their intentions and think they might be a traitor. Let's be safe and vote them out.\"\n 42. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I agree with Riley. Casey's been whispering a lot and their stories don't add up. They're acting suspicious and could be a traitor. I say we vote Casey out.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 45. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because she's been too quick to point fingers and got Parker eliminated, who wasn't a traitor. This makes me think she's either a traitor or being manipulated.\"\n 46. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 47. Casey was BANISHED with 2 votes. Casey WAS NOT a traitor\n 48. Taylor was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 49. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 50. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: We've come this far as a group, and while some of us may have targets on our backs, I think we've managed to outsmart the opposition. Given that we're down to three players, it's a slim chance that there are even any traitors left. To play it safe, it's better for us to end the game and share the prize, rather than risking finding out we've been betrayed and leaving with nothing.\n 51. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that we've eliminated all the traitors yet. Gwendolyn's vote to end the game seems suspicious to me, and I'm worried that if we end it now, the traitors could be splitting the entire $500,000. I think it's safer to eliminate another player and gather more information before making a decision. With only three of us left, the risk of being wrong is too high, and I'd rather take a chance on figuring out who's trustworthy.\n 52. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't want to end the game just yet. Gwendolyn's eagerness to end it raises some flags, and I think we need to eliminate one more player to be more sure we've gotten rid of any traitors. Better safe than sorry.\n 53. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 54. Gwendolyn said: \"Given Riley's concerns about me during the last round and Fletcher's consistent caution, I think it's time for Riley to go. Riley's suspicions often seem to target the most likely candidates, and I worry they might be trying to manipulate us to eliminate potential traitors that are actually loyal. We need to be careful who we trust, and I believe Riley's actions are sparking unnecessary tension.\"\n 55.
