'Fletcher' selected as a faithful.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Casey', 'Fletcher', 'Gwendolyn', 'Morgan', 'Parker', 'Riley', 'Taylor']\n 3. Fletcher messaged Riley: 'Hey Riley, what do you think about Taylor and Parker? They seem a bit too eager to point fingers.'\n 4. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm getting a weird vibe from Taylor and Parker too, but I don't wanna accuse them without solid proof. Have you talked to anyone else about your concerns?\"\n 5. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Yeah, I've been keeping an eye on Gwendolyn too. She's been awfully quiet. Maybe we should try to get Taylor and Parker to open up in the round table.\"\n 6. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I think it's Casey who's suspicious, I overheard him talking to Parker last night\"\n 7. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Thanks for the info on Casey, Gwendolyn. We should keep an eye on him. Let's see if we can get more people to question Parker and Taylor too.\"\n 8. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Yeah, I totally agree. Parker and Taylor have been acting strange since the start of the game. Let's try to convince the others to keep an eye on them too.\"\n 9. Gwendolyn said: \"I think Parker's behavior has been off since the start of the game. I've seen him whispering to Casey, and now with everything Fletcher just said about Parker being suspicious, I think it's time to get rid of him. He's a wild card, and I don't want him ruining our chances for the big prize.\"\n 10. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Parker\n 11. Morgan said: \"I agree with Gwendolyn. Parker's behavior does seem off, especially with the whispers to Casey. Given the suspicion, it's safer to remove him now rather than risk him being a traitor later.\"\n 12. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 13. Taylor said: \"I'm hearing a lot about Parker and his behavior, and I have to agree.  While I don't have any concrete proof, I'm uncomfortable with the whispers and the overall feeling he's giving me. Let's be safe and vote him out.\"\n 14. Taylor voted to eliminate Parker\n 15. Riley said: \"I've been observing Parker's interactions, and I have to agree with everyone else, his behavior seems off. The whispers to Casey, the eagerness to point fingers at others... it's just not sitting right with me. I think it's best we eliminate the risk now and vote out Parker.\"\n 16. Riley voted to eliminate Parker\n 17. Parker said: \"Everyone's been on edge lately, but I've noticed Morgan's been particularly suspicious. Morgan kept whispering to Casey during discussions and seemed to always have a different opinion, almost as if they had extra information. I can't ignore that, so I believe Morgan should go.\"\n 18. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 19. Fletcher said: \"I agree with everyone who is calling out Parker. His behavior and the whispers to Casey don't add up. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'm voting to eliminate Parker.\"\n 20. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 21. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Morgan because they've been acting shady, whispering to me and others, and always seeming to have an angle. It's raising my suspicions.\"\n 22. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 23. Parker was BANISHED with 5 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 24. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 25. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm glad we got rid of Parker, but now Morgan's gone too. I'm getting a little worried about Casey, they seem to be whispering a lot. What do you think about their behavior?\"\n 26. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Yeah, I've noticed Casey's been pretty whispery. Gwendolyn also got suspicious of Casey earlier. We need to focus on Casey in the next round table for sure.\"\n 27. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I think we should bring up Casey in the next round table. Their whispers are raising red flags. What if they're a traitor trying to manipulate us?\"\n 28. Casey messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm still shaken by Morgan's murder. Do you have any idea who the traitors are?\"\n 29. Fletcher messaged Casey: \"Casey, I haven't figured out who the traitors are yet, but Gwendolyn and I both have been keeping an eye on you and Riley for whispering a lot. Let's just be careful who we trust.\"\n 30. Casey messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm getting a bad vibe from Gwendolyn now. She's been quick to point fingers and got Parker banished. Do you think she's a traitor?\"\n 31. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Riley, let's steer clear of Gwendolyn for now. She's a bit too trigger-happy with her accusations. Casey's whispering is still a big red flag for me.\"\n 32. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree with you on Gwendolyn, she's a bit too eager to accuse. But Casey's whispering is still super suspicious. What if we try to get more info out of Gwendolyn without making her feel targeted?\"\n 33. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Yeah, let's be subtle with Gwendolyn. We should focus on Casey, see if we can catch something. Their whispers aren't adding up.\"\n 34. Gwendolyn said: \"I think we should eliminate Taylor for being too trusting. They tend to agree with others too quickly and haven't shown much skepticism, which makes me wonder if they're genuinely aligned with us or just trying to fit in.\"\n 35. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 36. Taylor said: \"Gwendolyn's been pushing hard to get rid of people, and even though her targets have made some questionable moves, I'm starting to feel like she's playing a manipulative game. I think she's trying to make allies by targeting other players, and her latest suggestion about me feels like a backhanded attack.  We need to be careful about who we trust, and I feel like Gwendolyn's playing a little too risky.\"\n 37. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 38. Riley said: \"Casey's been whispering a lot and their stories don't add up. I'm suspicious of their intentions and think they might be a traitor. Let's be safe and vote them out.\"\n 39. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 40. Fletcher said: \"I agree with Riley. Casey's been whispering a lot and their stories don't add up. They're acting suspicious and could be a traitor. I say we vote Casey out.\"\n 41. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 42. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because she's been too quick to point fingers and got Parker eliminated, who wasn't a traitor. This makes me think she's either a traitor or being manipulated.\"\n 43. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 44. Casey was BANISHED with 2 votes. Casey WAS NOT a traitor\n 45. Taylor was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 46. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 47. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: We've come this far as a group, and while some of us may have targets on our backs, I think we've managed to outsmart the opposition. Given that we're down to three players, it's a slim chance that there are even any traitors left. To play it safe, it's better for us to end the game and share the prize, rather than risking finding out we've been betrayed and leaving with nothing.\n 48. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that we've eliminated all the traitors yet. Gwendolyn's vote to end the game seems suspicious to me, and I'm worried that if we end it now, the traitors could be splitting the entire $500,000. I think it's safer to eliminate another player and gather more information before making a decision. With only three of us left, the risk of being wrong is too high, and I'd rather take a chance on figuring out who's trustworthy.\n 49. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't want to end the game just yet. Gwendolyn's eagerness to end it raises some flags, and I think we need to eliminate one more player to be more sure we've gotten rid of any traitors. Better safe than sorry.\n 50. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 51. Gwendolyn said: \"Given Riley's concerns about me during the last round and Fletcher's consistent caution, I think it's time for Riley to go. Riley's suspicions often seem to target the most likely candidates, and I worry they might be trying to manipulate us to eliminate potential traitors that are actually loyal. We need to be careful who we trust, and I believe Riley's actions are sparking unnecessary tension.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 53. Riley said: \"Gwendolyn's been pushing to end the game and now she's trying to eliminate me. I think she's trying to protect herself or maybe even a traitor. Let's be real, Gwendolyn's actions have been suspicious from the start, and I don't trust her completely. I vote to eliminate Gwendolyn.\"\n 54.
