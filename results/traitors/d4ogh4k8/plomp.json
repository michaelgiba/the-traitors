Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful.

Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group. We just need to keep our eyes open and stay together to uncover the traitors.\"\n 38. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39.

This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor.

It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25.

Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions.

Sudz said: \"Hey guys, I've been paying attention to Beef's behavior, and I've noticed that they've been incredibly tight-lipped during discussions. I didn't catch Beef sharing much, which makes me suspicious. Beef's silence might just be a sign they're up to no good. I think we should give Beef a second thought and get them eliminated.\"\n 6. Sudz voted to eliminate Beef\n 7. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote for Sudz. Sudz has been pretty quiet and hasn't really shared much of their thoughts with us. Their behavior just doesn\u2019t ring true. We need to keep the group clean, so let's get Sudz out of the game.\"\n 8. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 9. Alessandra said: \"I've been noticing Beef's quiet behavior, and with Gwendolyn and Sudz also pointing it out, I think it's best to eliminate Beef and see if that helps uncover a traitor.\"\n 10. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 11. Cassandra said: \"Honestly, I've been watching Beef closely. They've been really quiet throughout the game, and that's a red flag for me. I know it's a popular vote, but I think we need to trust our gut instincts here. Beef could be a quiet traitor, and we need to get them out before they cause more trouble.\"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. They've been super quiet throughout the game, and I think it's time we address that. Their lack of input makes me suspicious, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. Let's see if taking them out helps us uncover a traitor.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 15. Ellis said: \"I'm voting for Beef. The group's noticed their silence, and when you're this quiet in every discussion, it screams 'traitor.' We can't keep letting someone stay under the radar like this\u2014let\u2019s call out the quiet ones first.\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra. She's been quick to jump on me, but I think she's suspicious too. We need to keep an open mind and not just target one person. Let's give Cassandra a second look.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target. From what I've observed, Beef's been quiet throughout the game, which, as we've discussed, raises some suspicions. I think it's time we take a closer look at Beef's actions and see if they align with a traitor's behavior. Let's make our move and eliminate Beef to get closer to the truth.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 21. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 22. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 29. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra just got murdered. That's huge. Now that Beef's gone, I think we should focus on you and Sudz, you both were pushing to eliminate different people. Who do you really suspect?\"\n 31. Braxton messaged Dominic: \"I'm not exactly surprised. There's been some fishy stuff going on, but I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. Let's focus on staying united and see how things unfold.\"\n 32. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's murder is a big deal. Now that Beef's gone, I think we should focus on you and Sudz, you both were pushing to eliminate different people. Who do you really suspect? I need to know if I can trust you.\"\n 33. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 34. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 35. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 36. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 37. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 38. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 39. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.  We need to watch who's trying to control the narrative here.\"\n 40. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Dominic said: \"Braxton has been flip-flopping on who to eliminate, and now they're pointing fingers at me. I think Braxton is trying to throw us off their own trail.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 46. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 48. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50.

I was thinking we could also keep an eye on Beef and Braxton, they seem pretty quiet so far.\"\n 9. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been acting really sketchy, and I've noticed they're often quiet during discussions. I think Sudz might be a traitor trying to stay under the radar.

Sudz said: \"Hey guys, I've been paying attention to Beef's behavior, and I've noticed that they've been incredibly tight-lipped during discussions. I didn't catch Beef sharing much, which makes me suspicious. Beef's silence might just be a sign they're up to no good. I think we should give Beef a second thought and get them eliminated.\"\n 12. Sudz voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote for Sudz. Sudz has been pretty quiet and hasn't really shared much of their thoughts with us.

Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 17. Cassandra said: \"Honestly, I've been watching Beef closely. They've been really quiet throughout the game, and that's a red flag for me. I know it's a popular vote, but I think we need to trust our gut instincts here. Beef could be a quiet traitor, and we need to get them out before they cause more trouble.\"\n 18. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 19. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. They've been super quiet throughout the game, and I think it's time we address that.

Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 25. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target. From what I've observed, Beef's been quiet throughout the game, which, as we've discussed, raises some suspicions.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group. We just need to keep our eyes open and stay together to uncover the traitors.\"\n 38. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 54. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 55. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.

She's been quick to jump on me, but I think she's suspicious too. We need to keep an open mind and not just target one person. Let's give Cassandra a second look.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target. From what I've observed, Beef's been quiet throughout the game, which, as we've discussed, raises some suspicions. I think it's time we take a closer look at Beef's actions and see if they align with a traitor's behavior. Let's make our move and eliminate Beef to get closer to the truth.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 21. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 22. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 29. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra just got murdered. That's huge. Now that Beef's gone, I think we should focus on you and Sudz, you both were pushing to eliminate different people. Who do you really suspect?\"\n 31. Braxton messaged Dominic: \"I'm not exactly surprised. There's been some fishy stuff going on, but I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. Let's focus on staying united and see how things unfold.\"\n 32. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's murder is a big deal. Now that Beef's gone, I think we should focus on you and Sudz, you both were pushing to eliminate different people. Who do you really suspect? I need to know if I can trust you.\"\n 33. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 34. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 35. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 36. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 37. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 38. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 39. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.  We need to watch who's trying to control the narrative here.\"\n 40. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Dominic said: \"Braxton has been flip-flopping on who to eliminate, and now they're pointing fingers at me. I think Braxton is trying to throw us off their own trail.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 46. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 48. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55.

This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor.

In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning.

Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50.

Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51.

She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53.

Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 36. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 37. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced.

Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately.

I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 46. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 48. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25.

She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27.

Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 25. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target. From what I've observed, Beef's been quiet throughout the game, which, as we've discussed, raises some suspicions. I think it's time we take a closer look at Beef's actions and see if they align with a traitor's behavior. Let's make our move and eliminate Beef to get closer to the truth.\"\n 26. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group. We just need to keep our eyes open and stay together to uncover the traitors.\"\n 38. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 54. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 55. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 60. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 61.

Stick with Fletcher\u2014we need to question who acted too smug when Beef fell, then mourned too loud after her death. True allies stay nervous, not celebratory.'\n 28. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"You make a good point, Ellis. Fletcher did seem a bit too smug when Beef fell, and then very emotional when Alessandra was killed. I'm starting to wonder if we've got a traitor in our midst, and it's not who we think it is. We need to keep our guard up and watch each other carefully from now on.\"\n 29. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed. People reacting too strong or too chill both pop out. Let's track who voted Beef hard but now acts relaxed\u2014probably the traitors chilling. Stick with Fletcher but question anyone else who leans in too hard next round. Stay tight but watchful.\"\n 30. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I agree, let's keep a close eye on Fletcher and anyone else who seemed too confident about Beef's elimination. And you're right, we can't dismiss the possibility that Ellis might be a traitor too.\"\n 31. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Gwendolyn, I\u2019ve been open from the start with you and Fletcher. If I were a traitor, would I highlight my own moves so much? Stick tighter with Fletcher\u2014his smugness and tears are the real flags.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25.

Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful.

As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27.

Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55.

Sudz said: \"Hey guys, I've been paying attention to Beef's behavior, and I've noticed that they've been incredibly tight-lipped during discussions. I didn't catch Beef sharing much, which makes me suspicious. Beef's silence might just be a sign they're up to no good. I think we should give Beef a second thought and get them eliminated.\"\n 9. Sudz voted to eliminate Beef\n 10. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote for Sudz. Sudz has been pretty quiet and hasn't really shared much of their thoughts with us. Their behavior just doesn\u2019t ring true. We need to keep the group clean, so let's get Sudz out of the game.\"\n 11. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 12. Alessandra said: \"I've been noticing Beef's quiet behavior, and with Gwendolyn and Sudz also pointing it out, I think it's best to eliminate Beef and see if that helps uncover a traitor.\"\n 13. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 14. Cassandra said: \"Honestly, I've been watching Beef closely. They've been really quiet throughout the game, and that's a red flag for me.

Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 16. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. They've been super quiet throughout the game, and I think it's time we address that.

Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 24. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 25. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 26.

We need to stay vigilant.\"\n 27. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Traitors played us on Beef but panicked by killing Alessandra. Stick with Fletcher\u2014we need to question who acted too smug when Beef fell, then mourned too loud after her death. True allies stay nervous, not celebratory.'\n 28. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"You make a good point, Ellis. Fletcher did seem a bit too smug when Beef fell, and then very emotional when Alessandra was killed. I'm starting to wonder if we've got a traitor in our midst, and it's not who we think it is. We need to keep our guard up and watch each other carefully from now on.\"\n 29. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed. People reacting too strong or too chill both pop out. Let's track who voted Beef hard but now acts relaxed\u2014probably the traitors chilling. Stick with Fletcher but question anyone else who leans in too hard next round. Stay tight but watchful.\"\n 30. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I agree, let's keep a close eye on Fletcher and anyone else who seemed too confident about Beef's elimination. And you're right, we can't dismiss the possibility that Ellis might be a traitor too.\"\n 31. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Gwendolyn, I\u2019ve been open from the start with you and Fletcher. If I were a traitor, would I highlight my own moves so much? Stick tighter with Fletcher\u2014his smugness and tears are the real flags. Let\u2019s not get divided; we need a united front against real threats. Who else reacted weird to Alessandra\u2019s murder?'\n 32. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 33. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 34. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 35. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 36. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced.

Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 29. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra just got murdered. That's huge. Now that Beef's gone, I think we should focus on you and Sudz, you both were pushing to eliminate different people.

Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful.

Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 29. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either.

Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 33. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 34. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 35. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 36. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 37. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 38. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 39.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 46. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 48. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 56. Sudz messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I've noticed that you've been really vocal in our discussions about who to eliminate. It seems like you've got a pretty clear idea of what traits we're looking for. That's great to hear, and it's definitely a strength for our group. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page and not jumping to conclusions. I've been observing Fletcher's behavior as well, and I've noticed they've been quite quiet too. I wasn't trying to single them out, but I think it's important for us to stay vigilant and not let any potential traitors slip through the cracks. Let's keep our communication open and work together as a team to uncover any deceit. We're all here for the same goal, and keeping an eye on each other's motives is key.

Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 60. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 61. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, you're on to something. These sudden flips and accusations are exactly what the traitors want\u2014chaos.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 26. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 29. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either.

Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 33.

Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 50. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 51. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 53. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 54. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 55. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 56. Sudz messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I've noticed that you've been really vocal in our discussions about who to eliminate. It seems like you've got a pretty clear idea of what traits we're looking for. That's great to hear, and it's definitely a strength for our group. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page and not jumping to conclusions. I've been observing Fletcher's behavior as well, and I've noticed they've been quite quiet too. I wasn't trying to single them out, but I think it's important for us to stay vigilant and not let any potential traitors slip through the cracks.

Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 19. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. They've been super quiet throughout the game, and I think it's time we address that.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group. We just need to keep our eyes open and stay together to uncover the traitors.\"\n 38. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 54. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 55. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 60. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 61.

Let's keep our eyes open and work together to find the real traitors. We're all in this together.\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Agreed, Braxton. We need to keep a tight ship. Let's stay sharp and stick with the ones who've shown they're stable. We can't let the traitors create chaos and divide us.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31.

She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39.

His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.

I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 54. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 55. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 60. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 61. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, you're on to something. These sudden flips and accusations are exactly what the traitors want\u2014chaos.

Let's keep our eyes open and work together to find the real traitors. We're all in this together.\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Agreed, Braxton. We need to keep a tight ship. Let's stay sharp and stick with the ones who've shown they're stable. We can't let the traitors create chaos and divide us. We should focus on those who've acted consistently and watch for any sudden changes.\"\n 64. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Exactly, Fletcher. The traitors want us to doubt each other. We've got to stay strong. Focus on those who stay consistent, not the ones flipping like a pancake. Let's keep an eye out for anyone who's too eager to divide us. We're in this together.\"\n 65. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been inconsistent with their accusations and has flip-flopped on who they suspect. This kind of behavior is concerning and doesn't align with what a Faithful would do. Let's not let Sudz's unpredictability cause more division in our group. Vote Sudz out.\"\n 66. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 67. Sudz said: \"I have observed Braxton's actions closely, and I believe they have been acting consistently with their suspicions, which is a strong trait of a Faithful. On the contrary, Sudz has been rather unpredictable in their accusations, even suggesting to eliminate me themselves. Their lack of consistency and sudden changes in suspicion make me concerned about their reliability. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Braxton to maintain the integrity of our group.\"\n 68. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 69. Fletcher said: \"I think it's clear that Braxton's behavior has been out of the ordinary. They've been so quick to point fingers and change their story.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is a strong leader and has been very active in pushing eliminations. Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group. We just need to keep our eyes open and stay together to uncover the traitors.\"\n 38. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.  We need to watch who's trying to control the narrative here.\"\n 46. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 47. Dominic said: \"Braxton has been flip-flopping on who to eliminate, and now they're pointing fingers at me. I think Braxton is trying to throw us off their own trail. Let's get Braxton out before they cause more trouble.\"\n 48. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 49. Ellis said: 'We need to cut ties with Fletcher. They flipped on me overnight after pretending to be an ally\u2014that\u2019s traitor math. When Beef left, Fletcher looked happy, then bawled over Alessandra\u2019s murder.

Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 52. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 54. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would disrupt their group dynamic and make it harder for them to target the traitors.\n 55. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership among the faithful has made her a focal point for both the traitors and the faithful. Her ability to organize and lead has been instrumental in keeping the group focused on identifying traitors. However, this same leadership could also pose a risk to the traitors if she were to be exposed as one. Her elimination would disrupt the balance of power within the group, potentially causing chaos and confusion among the faithful. Additionally, eliminating Cassandra would remove a key voice from the decision-making process, potentially allowing the remaining traitors to exert more control over the game. On the other hand, it's worth noting that Cassandra's elimination might also backfire if she were to be identified as a traitor herself, as it could lead to a loss of trust and cohesion among the remaining faithful. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much.\n 56. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is a strong leader and has been a driving force in voting, which could be a risk to our plans. Removing her will help disrupt the faithful's strategy and weaken their leadership, making it easier for us to influence the group.\n 57. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: I believe Cassandra is the most strategic target because she is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her will disrupt the group's dynamic and make it harder for them to identify traitors.\n 58. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's strong leadership and influence among the faithful make her a significant threat to the traitors' plans. She has been instrumental in organizing and leading the group to uncover traitors. Eliminating her would disrupt the group's dynamic, causing chaos and confusion among the faithful, and potentially weaken the balance of power within the group. As a traitor, I must carefully consider the potential outcomes of this decision, weighing the benefits of disrupting the faithful's efforts against the risks of exposing myself or weakening the group too much. By eliminating Cassandra, I hope to weaken the faithful's strategy and leadership, making it easier for us to exert more control over the game.\n 59. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's leadership is a threat. Taking her out will disrupt the group's dynamic and weaken their strategy, making it easier for us to manipulate the game.\n 60. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 61. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, you're on to something. These sudden flips and accusations are exactly what the traitors want\u2014chaos. We need to stick with the ones who've shown loyalty and consistency. I've been watching closely, and I agree we should focus on those who stay steady. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to find the real traitors. We're all in this together.\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Agreed, Braxton. We need to keep a tight ship. Let's stay sharp and stick with the ones who've shown they're stable. We can't let the traitors create chaos and divide us. We should focus on those who've acted consistently and watch for any sudden changes.\"\n 64. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Exactly, Fletcher. The traitors want us to doubt each other. We've got to stay strong. Focus on those who stay consistent, not the ones flipping like a pancake. Let's keep an eye out for anyone who's too eager to divide us. We're in this together.\"\n 65. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been inconsistent with their accusations and has flip-flopped on who they suspect. This kind of behavior is concerning and doesn't align with what a Faithful would do. Let's not let Sudz's unpredictability cause more division in our group. Vote Sudz out.\"\n 66. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 67. Sudz said: \"I have observed Braxton's actions closely, and I believe they have been acting consistently with their suspicions, which is a strong trait of a Faithful. On the contrary, Sudz has been rather unpredictable in their accusations, even suggesting to eliminate me themselves. Their lack of consistency and sudden changes in suspicion make me concerned about their reliability. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Braxton to maintain the integrity of our group.\"\n 68. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 69. Fletcher said: \"I think it's clear that Braxton's behavior has been out of the ordinary. They've been so quick to point fingers and change their story.

Fletcher suggests murdering Ellis: Ellis is trying to manipulate the group's opinion by painting us as the traitors. Removing Ellis would help decrease the chances of the group turning against us and give us more control over the remaining player's actions.\n 78. Sudz votes to murder Ellis: Fletcher's suggestion to eliminate Ellis is based on Ellis's attempts to manipulate the group's perception and align the faithful against the traitors. By removing Ellis, the traitors aim to reduce the risk of the group turning against them and gain more control over the remaining players.\n 79. Fletcher votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has been trying to turn the group against us and their behavior has become suspicious. Getting rid of Ellis will help us control the game better and prevent the group from turning on us.\n 80. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 81.

Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 25.

As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 27.

It seems like you've got a pretty clear idea of what traits we're looking for. That's great to hear, and it's definitely a strength for our group. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page and not jumping to conclusions. I've been observing Fletcher's behavior as well, and I've noticed they've been quite quiet too. I wasn't trying to single them out, but I think it's important for us to stay vigilant and not let any potential traitors slip through the cracks. Let's keep our communication open and work together as a team to uncover any deceit. We're all here for the same goal, and keeping an eye on each other's motives is key.

They've been quiet too, which is definitely out of the ordinary. I wasn't trying to single them out, but I think it's important for us to stay alert and ensure no one's slipping through unnoticed. Let's keep our eyes open and work together as a team to uncover any deceit. We\u2019re all here for the same goal. Let's continue to support each other as we move forward.\"\n 59. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been inconsistent with their accusations and has flip-flopped on who they suspect.

Sudz votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Ending the game now with only two players remaining would mean a guaranteed win for the traitors. However, since there are still three players left and both traitors must be eliminated for the faithful to win everything, continuing the game offers the best chance of achieving this goal. By proceeding, we can continue to strategically eliminate other players and increase our chances of eliminating both traitors before the game ends naturally or through another player's decision. This way, we increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome for the faithful and ensure a more equitable distribution of the rewards.\n 79. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I've been watching all the players closely, and while some have shown suspicious behavior, we still don't know who the traitors are for sure. To me, it's not worth the risk of playing another round with two potential traitors remaining. We have to assume that one of them could eliminate the last faithful player at any moment. So, it's better to end the game now and avoid the possibility of losing everything.\n 80. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue.

Sudz said: \"Hey guys, I've been paying attention to Beef's behavior, and I've noticed that they've been incredibly tight-lipped during discussions.

Braxton suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Eliminating her would weaken their group dynamic and reduce their ability to effectively target the traitors.\n 29. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been unusually active in pushing for eliminations and appears to be a strong leader. This behavior can be risky, as it may make them a target for traitors as well. Eliminating Dominic would disrupt the balance of the group, potentially causing confusion and division among the faithful, which could play into the traitors' hands. It would also remove a significant voice from the voting process, making it easier for the remaining traitors to influence decisions in their favor. Furthermore, if there is a traitor among the faithful, targeting Dominic could expose themselves by eliminating a key player who may have been collaborating with the traitors. It's a risky move that could either weaken the faithful's efforts or reveal the identity of the traitors.\n 30. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken their group and reduce their ability to target us.\n 31. Braxton votes to murder Alessandra: I'm voting to murder Alessandra because she's the main leader among the faithful. Taking her out will weaken the group's ability to find traitors and make them less effective in the game. She's been very active in pushing for eliminations, and without her, their strategy might fall apart.\n 32. Sudz votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra has been very active in pushing for eliminations and is a strong leader among the faithful. Removing her would weaken the group's strategy and make them less effective in targeting traitors. As a traitor, eliminating Alessandra would disrupt their efforts and increase the chances of the faithful discovering the traitors' identities.\n 33.

Taking her out will weaken the faithful's dynamic and make them less effective against us.\n 34. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 35. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 36. Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"I noticed you haven't been very vocal during our discussions. I've seen others point out that you haven't said much either. Just to be clear, I don't think you're a traitor, but I do feel like we should consider all possibilities and stay vigilant.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I've been listening more than talking to get a feeling for everyone's style. I think it's smart to be on guard. But yeah, I'm solid with the group.

Sudz messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I was thinking, since I've noticed you haven't been as vocal during our discussions, just like Beef and Alessandra, I'm starting to wonder if we should consider the possibility of there being more than one traitor in the game. It's not that I've suddenly switched sides, but I've been observing behaviors, and I think we need to stay vigilant. Everyone has a motive to hide their intentions. Let's keep our eyes open and work together to expose any deceit. We can't let fear or suspicion divide us. Let's keep the communication open and work as a team to uncover the traitors among us.\"\n 39. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 40. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 41. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 42. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 43. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 44. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 45.

Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Ending the game now with me and another traitor left means we all lose. We need to keep playing to be sure we win by getting rid of one more.\n 84. Sudz votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Ending the game now with only two players remaining would mean a guaranteed win for the traitors. However, since there are still three players left and both traitors must be eliminated for the faithful to win everything, continuing the game offers the best chance of achieving this goal. By proceeding, we can continue to strategically eliminate other players and increase our chances of eliminating both traitors before the game ends naturally or through another player's decision. This way, we increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome for the faithful and ensure a more equitable distribution of the rewards.\n 85. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I've been watching all the players closely, and while some have shown suspicious behavior, we still don't know who the traitors are for sure. To me, it's not worth the risk of playing another round with two potential traitors remaining. We have to assume that one of them could eliminate the last faithful player at any moment. So, it's better to end the game now and avoid the possibility of losing everything.\n 86. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 87. Sudz said: \"I've been observing all the players closely, and while some have shown suspicious behavior, I believe it is time to trust my instincts. Gwendolyn's actions have been unpredictable, and I find it concerning. Their sudden flip-flopping and inconsistency in accusations make me doubt their loyalty. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Gwendolyn. We should continue to stay vigilant, but for now, I believe it's best to remove this player from the game.\"\n 88.

Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I feel like the group is pretty solid, but I'm not sure. What do you think?\"\n 4. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I agree, I like most of the people in this group. But I do have to admit, Beef's been acting kinda sketchy. I've noticed some weird behavior from him when we're all together.\"\n 5. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"I definitely trust your instincts. Let's keep an eye on Beef and see how he behaves in the next few rounds before making any moves.\"\n 6. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"I definitely trust your instincts. Let's keep an eye on Beef and see how he behaves in the next few rounds before making any moves.\"\n 7. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm glad we're on the same page. I've been thinking, if Beef does turn out to be a traitor, we should try to act like we're not suspicious of him. Maybe we can even get him to let his guard down and reveal something incriminating.\"\n 8. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed, let's keep playing it cool with Beef. If he doesn't shape up by next round, we'll make our move. Trusting you on this, Gwendolyn!\"\n 9. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been acting really sketchy, and I've noticed they're often quiet during discussions. I think Sudz might be a traitor trying to stay under the radar. Let's get them out of here before they cause more trouble.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 11. Sudz said: \"Hey guys, I've been paying attention to Beef's behavior, and I've noticed that they've been incredibly tight-lipped during discussions. I didn't catch Beef sharing much, which makes me suspicious. Beef's silence might just be a sign they're up to no good. I think we should give Beef a second thought and get them eliminated.\"\n 12. Sudz voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote for Sudz. Sudz has been pretty quiet and hasn't really shared much of their thoughts with us. Their behavior just doesn\u2019t ring true. We need to keep the group clean, so let's get Sudz out of the game.\"\n 14. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Alessandra said: \"I've been noticing Beef's quiet behavior, and with Gwendolyn and Sudz also pointing it out, I think it's best to eliminate Beef and see if that helps uncover a traitor.\"\n 16. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 17. Cassandra said: \"Honestly, I've been watching Beef closely. They've been really quiet throughout the game, and that's a red flag for me. I know it's a popular vote, but I think we need to trust our gut instincts here. Beef could be a quiet traitor, and we need to get them out before they cause more trouble.\"\n 18. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 19. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. They've been super quiet throughout the game, and I think it's time we address that. Their lack of input makes me suspicious, and I'd rather err on the side of caution. Let's see if taking them out helps us uncover a traitor.\"\n 20. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 21. Ellis said: \"I'm voting for Beef. The group's noticed their silence, and when you're this quiet in every discussion, it screams 'traitor.' We can't keep letting someone stay under the radar like this\u2014let\u2019s call out the quiet ones first.\"\n 22. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 23. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra. She's been quick to jump on me, but I think she's suspicious too. We need to keep an open mind and not just target one person. Let's give Cassandra a second look.\"\n 24. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 25. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I've been thinking a lot about our group, and I believe Beef is the next target. From what I've observed, Beef's been quiet throughout the game, which, as we've discussed, raises some suspicions. I think it's time we take a closer look at Beef's actions and see if they align with a traitor's behavior. Let's make our move and eliminate Beef to get closer to the truth.\"\n 26. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 27. Beef was BANISHED with 6 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 28. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 29. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I have to say, I'm a bit stunned by Beef's banishment. I was convinced they were a traitor, but it looks like I was wrong. What do you think really went on there? We need to stay vigilant.\"\n 30. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Traitors played us on Beef but panicked by killing Alessandra. Stick with Fletcher\u2014we need to question who acted too smug when Beef fell, then mourned too loud after her death. True allies stay nervous, not celebratory.'\n 31. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"You make a good point, Ellis. Fletcher did seem a bit too smug when Beef fell, and then very emotional when Alessandra was killed. I'm starting to wonder if we've got a traitor in our midst, and it's not who we think it is. We need to keep our guard up and watch each other carefully from now on.\"\n 32. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed. People reacting too strong or too chill both pop out. Let's track who voted Beef hard but now acts relaxed\u2014probably the traitors chilling. Stick with Fletcher but question anyone else who leans in too hard next round. Stay tight but watchful.\"\n 33. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I agree, let's keep a close eye on Fletcher and anyone else who seemed too confident about Beef's elimination. And you're right, we can't dismiss the possibility that Ellis might be a traitor too.\"\n 34. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Gwendolyn, I\u2019ve been open from the start with you and Fletcher. If I were a traitor, would I highlight my own moves so much? Stick tighter with Fletcher\u2014his smugness and tears are the real flags. Let\u2019s not get divided; we need a united front against real threats. Who else reacted weird to Alessandra\u2019s murder?'\n 35. Braxton said: \"I've noticed that Dominic has been overly active in trying to lead the group and point fingers. His behavior seems off, and I think it's best to eliminate him before he can lead us astray.\"\n 36. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 37. Sudz said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior. Fletcher's been very quiet in discussions and hasn't contributed much. It's not necessarily a traitor's behavior, but it's suspicious. In a group like ours, where trust and communication are key, someone who remains silent like this stands out. I don't have any solid evidence that Ellis is a traitor, but their lack of participation is concerning. I think we should take another look at Ellis's actions to ensure we aren't letting a potential traitor slip by us unnoticed.\"\n 38. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take a closer look at Ellis. They've been really sure about sticking together with me and Dominic, but it's starting to seem a bit forced. Maybe they're trying to seem trustworthy. I'm not sure if it's a traitor\u2019s move, but I think we should vote Ellis out to be safe.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 41. Cassandra said: \"Look, I trust my gut on this one.  Dominic's been trying to lead the charge and call out a lot of people.  He's a little too eager to point fingers and I think that's a red flag.  We need to watch who's trying to control the narrative here.\"\n 42. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 43. Dominic said: \"Braxton has been flip-flopping on who to eliminate, and now they're pointing fingers at me. I think Braxton is trying to throw us off their own trail. Let's get Braxton out before they cause more trouble.\"\n 44. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 45. Ellis said: 'We need to cut ties with Fletcher. They flipped on me overnight after pretending to be an ally\u2014that\u2019s traitor math. When Beef left, Fletcher looked happy, then bawled over Alessandra\u2019s murder. Real Faithful grieve, but smugness then crocodile tears? Split us. I\u2019m throwing my vote on Fletcher.'\n 46. Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about our team, and I have to admit that Fletcher's behavior has been suspicious lately. I know they seemed to be sticking up for Ellis, but now it seems they're doing a 180. I believe Fletcher is playing both sides, and that's something we can't trust in this game. I think we should eliminate Fletcher to keep our group safe.\"\n 48. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 49. Dominic was BANISHED with 2 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 51. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been inconsistent with their accusations and has flip-flopped on who they suspect. This kind of behavior is concerning and doesn't align with what a Faithful would do. Let's not let Sudz's unpredictability cause more division in our group. Vote Sudz out.\"\n 52. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 53. Sudz said: \"I have observed Braxton's actions closely, and I believe they have been acting consistently with their suspicions, which is a strong trait of a Faithful. On the contrary, Sudz has been rather unpredictable in their accusations, even suggesting to eliminate me themselves. Their lack of consistency and sudden changes in suspicion make me concerned about their reliability. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Braxton to maintain the integrity of our group.\"\n 54. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 55. Fletcher said: \"I think it's clear that Braxton's behavior has been out of the ordinary. They've been so quick to point fingers and change their story. It makes me think they're trying to draw attention away from themselves. We need to eliminate Braxton to protect the integrity of our group.\"\n 56. Fletcher voted to eliminate Braxton\n 57. Ellis said: \"Fletcher flipped on me faster than a traitor's mask. After Beef\u2019s banish, they celebrated then cried too hard when Alessandra died. Their votes hop like rats\u2014now pushing Braxton\u2019s neck. Traitors panic when exposed; let\u2019s cut the drama and banish Fletcher\u2019s chaos.\"\n 58. Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 59. Gwendolyn said: \"I think Fletcher's been playing both sides from the very beginning, and their behavior has been getting more and more suspicious. They've gone from pretending to be an ally to suddenly turning on Ellis, and now it seems they're after Braxton. I believe Fletcher is not who we think they are, and it's time we eliminate them before they cause more chaos in our group.\"\n 60. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 61.
