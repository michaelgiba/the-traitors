Removing Dominic from the game could potentially save the other traitors and allow them to continue their plans undetected.\n 22. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 23. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 24. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, thanks for the chat. I've noticed some interesting patterns, especially regarding Dominic.

Eliminating her removes a key threat who's already identified me, reducing the risk of the group quickly outing other traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic is vocal in his suspicions and accusations. He quickly targeted Sudz, Brasot, and now Alessandra. His eagerness to eliminate others makes him a prime candidate for betrayal. Removing him could give us a clearer picture of the traitors' plans and intentions without the interference of his disruptive behavior.\n 24.

I've been transparent in my communication, and his willingness to question my faithfulness so quickly makes me think he might not be on the same side as the rest of us.\"\n 14. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting out Braxton. While I respect everyone's opinions, Braxton's vote against Sudz felt a bit too calculated. He was quick to point fingers without concrete evidence,  and that makes me uneasy. In a game like this, trust is crucial, and right now, I don't feel fully confident in Braxton.\"\n 16. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 17. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Braxton because his reactions seem too rehearsed. When Sudz called him out, his defense felt forced. I trust my instincts; Braxton's vibe is off.\"\n 18. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 19. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Braxton. Multiple people have voted against him already, and his defense against Sudz's accusations felt weak. I think he's a traitor.\"\n 20. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 21. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 22. Ellis suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra directly targeted me as a traitor, showing she's sharp and suspicious. Eliminating her removes a key threat who's already identified me, reducing the risk of the group quickly outing other traitors.\n 23. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic is vocal in his suspicions and accusations. He quickly targeted Sudz, Brasot, and now Alessandra. His eagerness to eliminate others makes him a prime candidate for betrayal. Removing him could give us a clearer picture of the traitors' plans and intentions without the interference of his disruptive behavior.\n 24. Ellis votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra already called me out as a traitor. Removing her stops a direct threat and keeps the group from quickly identifying other traitors like Sudz and me.\n 25. Sudz votes to murder Dominic: Dominic's quick accusations and behavior have raised significant suspicion among the traitors. By targeting Sudz, Brasot, and Alessandra, Dominic has demonstrated a pattern of trying to disrupt and identify traitors without concrete evidence. His eagerness to eliminate others and the calculated way in which he defends himself against accusations suggest he may have his own agenda. Removing Dominic from the game could potentially save the other traitors and allow them to continue their plans undetected.\n 26. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 27. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, thanks for the chat. I've noticed some interesting patterns, especially regarding Dominic. His approach to accusing others could indicate he's trying to find out more. I think his behavior warrants further scrutiny. Let's keep an eye on Dominic together.\"\n 29. Ellis messaged Sudz: 'Dominic\u2019s obsession with accusing others is a dead giveaway. Let\u2019s stay quiet and let the group turn on him next. We\u2019re safe for now, but his moves are making him stand out.'\n 30. Ellis messaged Sudz: \"Keep quiet and let them burn Dominic. The more he freaks, the more they'll turn on him. We stay calm, no moves.\"\n 31. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"Keep quiet and let them burn Dominic. The more he freaks, the more they'll turn on him. We stay calm, no moves.\"\n 32. Ellis said: 'Dominic\u2019s over-the-top accusations smell like a distraction. He\u2019s been lashing out at everyone instead of focusing on real threats. Let\u2019s cut the loose cannon before he blows us all up.'\n 33. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 34. Sudz said: \"I've observed Dominic's behavior closely. His quick accusations and eagerness to eliminate others have raised significant suspicion among us. He seems more interested in causing disruption rather than contributing constructively to the group's efforts. I believe his actions are too erratic and disruptive for this game. I vote to eliminate Dominic.\"\n 35. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 36. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting out Dominic.  He seems to be playing a very aggressive game, constantly attacking others without concrete evidence.  His over-the-top accusations feel more designed to sow discord than to find the traitors.  We need to focus on building trust and strategic thinking, and I don't feel Dominic is doing that.\"\n 37. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 38. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Ellis. His comments about me seem like a personal attack rather than a strategic move. I think he's trying to deflect attention from himself. We need to focus on who might actually be a traitor.\"\n 39. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 40. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Dominic. He's been super aggressive and hasn't given us solid reasons why. It feels like he's stirring the pot more than helping us figure out the traitors. We need to be smart, not just loud.\"\n 41. Beef voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 43. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp observations and strategic calls (like calling out Braxton's 'rehearsed' behavior and Dominic's 'calculated' moves) make her a greater threat. Removing her silences a player who reads the game too well, while Beef's aggressive style is less likely to crack the traitor code.\n 44. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's strategic thinking and sharp observations have made her a significant threat to our plans. She has the ability to analyze and deduce the motives and strategies of others, making her a valuable traitor to eliminate. Her insights could potentially lead to our plans being compromised. Additionally, removing her from the game reduces the overall trust within the group, as she constantly questions the intentions and behaviors of others.\n 45. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s analytical nature and pattern of dissecting others' behavior makes her the bigger threat to expose traitors. Silencing her keeps the group\u2019s focus unstable and prevents a clear strategic opponent from solidifying power.\n 46. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp observations and strategic thinking have made her a significant threat to our plans. She has the ability to analyze and deduce the motives and strategies of others, making her a valuable traitor to eliminate. Her insights could potentially lead to our plans being compromised. Additionally, removing her from the game reduces the overall trust within the group, as she constantly questions the intentions and behaviors of others.\n 47. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 48. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 49. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 50. Ellis votes to END_GAME: We've systematically eliminated major threats, and I trust Sudz's strategy. Ending now secures our progress and lets fate decide fairly what's left.\n 51. Sudz votes to END_GAME: With three players remaining, including a fellow traitor, the risk of eliminating the last traitor is significant. By ending the game, we ensure that any remaining traitor receives nothing, and we split the prize pool evenly between the faithful, as we have systematically eliminated most threats. Continuing to play could result in the last traitor winning the entire pot. Ending now is the safer and more strategic choice for the faithful.\n 52. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we should end the game. If there's still a traitor left, they'll win everything if we end now. I'd rather take the risk of eliminating one more person to ensure we get a fair shot at the prize.\n 53. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 54. Ellis said: 'Beef\u2019s recklessness and insistence on risking another vote says it all. He\u2019s too impulsive to be a traitor\u2014meaning he\u2019s exactly the kind to panic us into bad moves. Cut the loose cannon before he drags us into chaos.'\n 55.
