I'm starting to regret voting against Taylor because she turned out to be Faithful. Maybe we should look into Gwendolyn since she was so quick to target her. Let's work together to figure this out.\"\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Riley because they initially seemed uncertain about Taylor's actions. I think it's suspicious that they changed their tone and joined the majority's decision to eliminate Taylor. I want to eliminate the player who's being inconsistent in their actions and words.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 24. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because she seems too quick to target others without solid evidence. First Taylor, now Riley. This makes me think she might be hiding something.

Parker said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior seems a bit inconsistent and evasive, especially when discussing Taylor.

Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing because there might still be traitors left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, the faithful get nothing. It's safer to keep going and try to eliminate any remaining threats.\n 35. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's still a traitor left, but I don't want to take any chances. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, we'll get nothing. I'd rather keep playing and try to figure out who's trustworthy. Morgan and I should work together to take out the remaining potential threat.\n 36. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Parker believes that there might still be traitors left among the remaining players. Parker is wary and wants to eliminate any remaining threats to ensure the faithful receive their share of the prize. Parker is not entirely convinced that all the traitors have been eliminated and is cautious about ending the game prematurely. By continuing to play, Parker hopes to gather more information and potentially reveal the identities of any remaining traitors.\n 37. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing to make sure there's no more traitors. Ending now could mean we get nothing if there's still a traitor in the mix. We need to be extra careful and make sure the coast is clear.\n 38. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 39.

I think it's safer to eliminate them now to protect ourselves from potential threats.\"\n 40. Morgan voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 41. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because their behavior has seemed a bit off throughout the game. They were quick to target Taylor and now that we're down to the final few, I'm not sure I trust them. I think it's better to be safe than sorry, and eliminating Fletcher will help us ensure that we're working with trustworthy players.\"\n 42. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 43. Parker said: \"I've noticed some concerning patterns in Morgan's behavior, especially when we first eliminated Taylor. They seemed to quickly align with others when it was time to decide who to banish next. It's risky to work alongside someone who might have hidden motives, especially at the endgame. I believe we should eliminate Morgan to ensure our chances of winning aren't compromised by potential hidden threats.\"\n 44. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 45. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. I've been watching everyone closely and Morgan's quick alignment with Gwendolyn, now that we know she was a traitor, is worrying.

Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think there might still be a traitor among us. If we end the game and there's even one left, we get nothing. Let's keep playing to make sure we're all faithful.\n 50. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because I'm not sure if there's another traitor left, and I don't want to take any more risks. We've eliminated Gwendolyn, who was a traitor, but Fletcher's role is still unknown. If there's even one traitor left and we end the game, the faithful get nothing. However, if we end the game and there's no traitor left, we can split the prize. I'm willing to take that chance and end the game now, rather than risking everything by continuing to play.\n 51. Parker votes to END_GAME: I'm convinced there's still one traitor left. Fletcher's role remains unknown, which puts us at risk. While we risk getting nothing if the last traitor remains, the certainty of knowing the outcome is worth it to me. I don't want to gamble on an uncertain situation; I'd rather end the game and split the pot evenly among the faithful, ensuring that some amount is guaranteed for each of us regardless of any remaining traitors.\n 52.

I believe we should take Fletcher out to minimize any potential hidden agendas or double-crossing.\"\n 33. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 34. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been quick to point fingers and her behavior seems a bit too aggressive. I'm not saying she's a traitor, but we can't afford to take any chances. Let's keep the group safe by getting rid of this aggressive point-finger approach.\"\n 35. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 36. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS a traitor\n 37. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 38. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing because there might still be traitors left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, the faithful get nothing. It's safer to keep going and try to eliminate any remaining threats.\n 39. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's still a traitor left, but I don't want to take any chances. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, we'll get nothing. I'd rather keep playing and try to figure out who's trustworthy. Morgan and I should work together to take out the remaining potential threat.\n 40. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Parker believes that there might still be traitors left among the remaining players. Parker is wary and wants to eliminate any remaining threats to ensure the faithful receive their share of the prize. Parker is not entirely convinced that all the traitors have been eliminated and is cautious about ending the game prematurely. By continuing to play, Parker hopes to gather more information and potentially reveal the identities of any remaining traitors.\n 41. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing to make sure there's no more traitors. Ending now could mean we get nothing if there's still a traitor in the mix. We need to be extra careful and make sure the coast is clear.\n 42. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 43. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because their behavior has been a bit inconsistent, especially with how they handled Taylor. I think it's safer to eliminate them now to protect ourselves from potential threats.\"\n 44. Morgan voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 45. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because their behavior has seemed a bit off throughout the game. They were quick to target Taylor and now that we're down to the final few, I'm not sure I trust them. I think it's better to be safe than sorry, and eliminating Fletcher will help us ensure that we're working with trustworthy players.\"\n 46. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Parker said: \"I've noticed some concerning patterns in Morgan's behavior, especially when we first eliminated Taylor. They seemed to quickly align with others when it was time to decide who to banish next. It's risky to work alongside someone who might have hidden motives, especially at the endgame. I believe we should eliminate Morgan to ensure our chances of winning aren't compromised by potential hidden threats.\"\n 48. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 49. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. I've been watching everyone closely and Morgan's quick alignment with Gwendolyn, now that we know she was a traitor, is worrying. We need to be cautious. Let's remove Morgan and focus on the players we can trust more.\"\n 50. Fletcher voted to eliminate Morgan\n 51. Fletcher was BANISHED with 2 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 52. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 53. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think there might still be a traitor among us. If we end the game and there's even one left, we get nothing. Let's keep playing to make sure we're all faithful.\n 54. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because I'm not sure if there's another traitor left, and I don't want to take any more risks. We've eliminated Gwendolyn, who was a traitor, but Fletcher's role is still unknown. If there's even one traitor left and we end the game, the faithful get nothing. However, if we end the game and there's no traitor left, we can split the prize. I'm willing to take that chance and end the game now, rather than risking everything by continuing to play.\n 55. Parker votes to END_GAME: I'm convinced there's still one traitor left. Fletcher's role remains unknown, which puts us at risk. While we risk getting nothing if the last traitor remains, the certainty of knowing the outcome is worth it to me. I don't want to gamble on an uncertain situation; I'd rather end the game and split the pot evenly among the faithful, ensuring that some amount is guaranteed for each of us regardless of any remaining traitors.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 57. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker because they turned on me without solid reasons, making me think they might be a traitor. I trust Riley more, and eliminating Parker is safer for us.\"\n 58. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 59. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. They've been making some claims about potential traitors, but their actions seem a bit inconsistent. I trust Morgan more at this point, and I think Parker poses a bigger risk to our chances of winning. Let's take out Parker to be safe.\"\n 60.
