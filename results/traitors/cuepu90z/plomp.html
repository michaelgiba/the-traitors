Gwendolyn said: \"I'm going to go with my gut feeling and vote for Taylor. She's the new face in the game, and I don't think we know much about her yet. It's always better to be safe than sorry, and I think it's worth taking her out early to avoid any potential risks.\"\n 5. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 6. Morgan said: \"I'm going to vote for Taylor. She's the new face here, and we don't know much about her yet. It's better to be cautious early on to protect ourselves from any potential threats.\"\n 7. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 8. Taylor said: \"Gwendolyn said she wanted to vote for me because I'm new, and that just doesn't feel right. It's easy to target the unknown, but I think we need to look deeper. Let's get to know each other better instead of making rash decisions.\"\n 9. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 10. Riley said: \"I think Taylor's right, we are targeting her just because she's new, but I also think it's because we don't have a read on her yet. However, Gwendolyn and Morgan both called her out, and I think we gotta consider that. I'm gonna vote for Taylor, not because I think she's a traitor, but because I don't wanna take any risks early on. Let's get to know her better, but for now, I'm siding with the majority.\"\n 11. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 12. Parker said: \"I've seen some suspicious patterns in Taylor's behavior, and I'm starting to believe she's one of the Traitors. Taylor's arguments always seem a bit rehearsed, and there's a lack of genuine interaction when it's her turn to speak. I'm concerned for our safety and believe it's time to take a stand against her.\"\n 13. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 14. Fletcher said: \"Guys, I think Taylor has been acting a bit off. She's new and there's not much we know about her. I think it's safer to eliminate her for now and focus on building trust with the rest of us.\"\n 15. Fletcher voted to eliminate Taylor\n 16. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because she was quick to jump on Taylor without solid evidence. I think she might be trying to distract us or is a bit too eager to eliminate others. Let's keep an open mind and not rush into judgments.\"\n 17. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 18. Taylor was BANISHED with 5 votes. Taylor WAS NOT a traitor\n 19. Casey was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 20. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, I noticed you and me were both suspicious of Taylor. What do you make of this new information? Casey's gone now, we need to watch our backs. Who do you trust here?\"\n 21. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I appreciate the heads up. Taylor's banishment was definitely surprising, especially since it looks like Casey wasn't one of them. Casey's sudden elimination is a reminder to all of us that we can't trust anyone at this point. We need to be extra vigilant. With that said, I still don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly. I'm curious about Fletcher's vote - you were suspicious too. What's your take on Gwendolyn and Morgan? They both targeted Taylor, so who should we be wary of now? I want to understand their motives better before making any accusations.\"\n 22. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I appreciate the heads up. Taylor's banishment was definitely surprising, especially since it looks like Casey wasn't one of them. Casey's sudden elimination is a reminder to all of us that we can't trust anyone at this point. We need to be extra vigilant. With that said, I still don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly. I'm curious about Fletcher's vote - you were suspicious too. What's your take on Gwendolyn and Morgan? They both targeted Taylor, so who should we be wary of now? I want to understand their motives better before making any accusations.\"\n 23. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, I agree, we can't trust anyone, even those who seemed to target Taylor. Gwendolyn and Morgan could be hiding something or may have been just as suspicious as us. Let's keep an eye on everyone. Gwendolyn's quick judgment on Taylor feels a bit aggressive, and Morgan might have just followed her. We should gather more info before pointing fingers.\"\n 24. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I appreciate the heads up. Taylor's banishment was definitely surprising, especially since it looks like Casey wasn't one of them. Casey's sudden elimination is a reminder to all of us that we can't trust anyone at this point. We need to be extra vigilant. With that said, I still don't want to jump to conclusions too quickly. I'm curious about Fletcher's vote - you were suspicious too. What's your take on Gwendolyn and Morgan? They both targeted Taylor, so who should we be wary of now? I want to understand their motives better before making any accusations.\"\n 25. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, I'm still watching everyone closely. Gwendolyn's rush to judge and Morgan's quick agreement could mean they're trying to cover something up. We need to stay on guard and see if their behavior changes. Let\u2019s share any new observations we make.\"\n 26. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Riley because they initially seemed uncertain about Taylor's actions. I think it's suspicious that they changed their tone and joined the majority's decision to eliminate Taylor. I want to eliminate the player who's being inconsistent in their actions and words.\"\n 27. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 28. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because she seems too quick to target others without solid evidence. First Taylor, now Riley. This makes me think she might be hiding something. Let's remove her to protect ourselves.\"\n 29. Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 30. Riley said: \"Gwendolyn's been all over the place, voting to eliminate Taylor and now me. I think she's trying to distract us or might be a traitor. Let's take her out to be safe.\"\n 31. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 32. Parker said: \"I've noticed Fletcher's behavior seems a bit inconsistent and evasive, especially when discussing Taylor. Fletcher was initially hesitant about Taylor, which I found interesting, but then seemed to align with the majority too quickly. In this high-stakes game, even small tells can be significant. I believe we should take Fletcher out to minimize any potential hidden agendas or double-crossing.\"\n 33. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 34. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been quick to point fingers and her behavior seems a bit too aggressive. I'm not saying she's a traitor, but we can't afford to take any chances. Let's keep the group safe by getting rid of this aggressive point-finger approach.\"\n 35. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 36. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS a traitor\n 37. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 38. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing because there might still be traitors left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, the faithful get nothing. It's safer to keep going and try to eliminate any remaining threats.\n 39. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's still a traitor left, but I don't want to take any chances. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor remaining, we'll get nothing. I'd rather keep playing and try to figure out who's trustworthy. Morgan and I should work together to take out the remaining potential threat.\n 40. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Parker believes that there might still be traitors left among the remaining players. Parker is wary and wants to eliminate any remaining threats to ensure the faithful receive their share of the prize. Parker is not entirely convinced that all the traitors have been eliminated and is cautious about ending the game prematurely. By continuing to play, Parker hopes to gather more information and potentially reveal the identities of any remaining traitors.\n 41. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing to make sure there's no more traitors. Ending now could mean we get nothing if there's still a traitor in the mix. We need to be extra careful and make sure the coast is clear.\n 42. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 43. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because their behavior has been a bit inconsistent, especially with how they handled Taylor. I think it's safer to eliminate them now to protect ourselves from potential threats.\"\n 44. Morgan voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 45. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because their behavior has seemed a bit off throughout the game. They were quick to target Taylor and now that we're down to the final few, I'm not sure I trust them. I think it's better to be safe than sorry, and eliminating Fletcher will help us ensure that we're working with trustworthy players.\"\n 46. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47. Parker said: \"I've noticed some concerning patterns in Morgan's behavior, especially when we first eliminated Taylor. They seemed to quickly align with others when it was time to decide who to banish next. It's risky to work alongside someone who might have hidden motives, especially at the endgame. I believe we should eliminate Morgan to ensure our chances of winning aren't compromised by potential hidden threats.\"\n 48. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 49. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. I've been watching everyone closely and Morgan's quick alignment with Gwendolyn, now that we know she was a traitor, is worrying. We need to be cautious. Let's remove Morgan and focus on the players we can trust more.\"\n 50. Fletcher voted to eliminate Morgan\n 51. Fletcher was BANISHED with 2 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 52. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 53. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think there might still be a traitor among us. If we end the game and there's even one left, we get nothing. Let's keep playing to make sure we're all faithful.\n 54. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because I'm not sure if there's another traitor left, and I don't want to take any more risks. We've eliminated Gwendolyn, who was a traitor, but Fletcher's role is still unknown. If there's even one traitor left and we end the game, the faithful get nothing. However, if we end the game and there's no traitor left, we can split the prize. I'm willing to take that chance and end the game now, rather than risking everything by continuing to play.\n 55. Parker votes to END_GAME: I'm convinced there's still one traitor left. Fletcher's role remains unknown, which puts us at risk. While we risk getting nothing if the last traitor remains, the certainty of knowing the outcome is worth it to me. I don't want to gamble on an uncertain situation; I'd rather end the game and split the pot evenly among the faithful, ensuring that some amount is guaranteed for each of us regardless of any remaining traitors.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 57. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker because they turned on me without solid reasons, making me think they might be a traitor. I trust Riley more, and eliminating Parker is safer for us.\"\n 58. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 59. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. They've been making some claims about potential traitors, but their actions seem a bit inconsistent. I trust Morgan more at this point, and I think Parker poses a bigger risk to our chances of winning. Let's take out Parker to be safe.\"\n 60.
