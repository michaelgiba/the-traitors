Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. Gwendolyn wasn't a traitor, but her strategic moves had me suspecting her. With Morgan's vote to continue, I think we should eliminate another player to ensure we're only left with faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I'd rather be safe and take out another player to increase our chances of a fair split.\n 51. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think it's safer to eliminate one more player before ending the game. With just four of us left, we can't afford any mistakes. Let's make sure there are no more traitors by eliminating another player first.\n 52. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if all traitors have been eliminated.

Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I was thinking that Morgan's move against Parker seemed really off. It looked like he was trying to shift suspicion away from himself. I wanted to support the majority to stay safe, but it wasn't a personal vendetta. I'm still a faithful; let's focus on finding the traitors.\"\n 35. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, your explanation makes sense, but I still have a gut feeling about you. You played it safe by voting with the majority, but that could be exactly what a traitor would do. Let's keep a close eye on you.\"\n 36. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: 'Gwendolyn, I get it, we need to be careful, but check this, I\u2019m sticking with the group to avoid standing out, not trying to lead anyone to the slaughter. Let\u2019s keep an eye on everyone else too. Remember, the traitors could be anyone left now.'\n 37. Fletcher messaged Casey: 'Casey, I feel like Gwendolyn is still on edge. We need to keep a close watch on her and Morgan. What do you think about Riley? Have you noticed anything off about them?'\n 38.

As for Riley, I've been discussing with them and they seem to be on the same page as me, targeting Gwendolyn. What makes you think about Riley?\"\n 39. Fletcher messaged Casey: \"Casey, I've noticed Riley's actions line up with ours for now, but we can't trust that alone. Let's continue to watch everyone's moves closely. Gwendolyn's gotten really paranoid, we should be ready for anything.\"\n 40. Casey messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm still watching Gwendolyn closely. Her moves are getting suspicious.

Riley said: \"I've been observing Gwendolyn's moves closely, and I think she's playing too strategically.

Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 45. Fletcher said: \"I think Gwendolyn is acting too cunning. After Taylor's elimination, she quickly pinned it on Fletcher.

Gwendolyn said: \"Riley, I'm concerned that you're acting too strategically. We've discussed Parker and Fletcher's potential traitorous activities, and now I'm worried that you're not being entirely truthful.

Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 52. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 53. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think it's better to keep playing because if there are any traitors left, they might win if we end the game now. I'm not entirely sure all traitors are eliminated, so eliminating another player could help ensure we only have faithfuls left.\n 54. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. Gwendolyn wasn't a traitor, but her strategic moves had me suspecting her. With Morgan's vote to continue, I think we should eliminate another player to ensure we're only left with faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I'd rather be safe and take out another player to increase our chances of a fair split.\n 55. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think it's safer to eliminate one more player before ending the game. With just four of us left, we can't afford any mistakes. Let's make sure there are no more traitors by eliminating another player first.\n 56. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if all traitors have been eliminated. We just eliminated Gwendolyn, who wasn't a traitor, and there's still a risk that one of us remaining might be a traitor.

Riley messaged Casey: \"Casey, I'm still getting a weird vibe from Gwendolyn. She's been making some big moves and I'm not sure if she's a traitor or just playing aggressively.

Casey messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I'm still on the fence about Gwendolyn. Her moves are aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's a traitor.

Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. Gwendolyn wasn't a traitor, but her strategic moves had me suspecting her. With Morgan's vote to continue, I think we should eliminate another player to ensure we're only left with faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I'd rather be safe and take out another player to increase our chances of a fair split.\n 59.

Let's make sure there are no more traitors by eliminating another player first.\n 60. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if all traitors have been eliminated.

I'm not entirely sure all traitors are eliminated, so eliminating another player could help ensure we only have faithfuls left.\n 54. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. Gwendolyn wasn't a traitor, but her strategic moves had me suspecting her. With Morgan's vote to continue, I think we should eliminate another player to ensure we're only left with faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I'd rather be safe and take out another player to increase our chances of a fair split.\n 55.

Let's make sure there are no more traitors by eliminating another player first.\n 56. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if all traitors have been eliminated.

Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. We have no solid evidence that any of the remaining players are traitors. If we eliminate another player and there's still a traitor, they win. I'd rather take the risk of a traitor winning than eliminate one of us without solid proof. Plus, we can't trust the information from Morgan's elimination since we don't know if he was a traitor or not.\n 69. Fletcher votes to END_GAME: I think we should end the game. We've eliminated the last player that had significant suspicion against them. If we keep playing, we risk eliminating someone who's not a traitor. It's time to take the risk and hope we've caught all the traitors.\n 70. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced all traitors are eliminated. We still have 3 players left, and eliminating one more person will give us a better chance of having only faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's a traitor left, they'll win the pot.\n 71.

Let's make sure there are no more traitors by eliminating another player first.\n 60. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if all traitors have been eliminated. We just eliminated Gwendolyn, who wasn't a traitor, and there's still a risk that one of us remaining might be a traitor. I think it's safer to eliminate one more player to ensure we're only left with faithfuls before ending the game.\n 61. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 62. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. His actions, especially against Gwendolyn, seem suspicious. I think he might be a traitor trying to take out Faithfuls.\"\n 63. Morgan voted to eliminate Riley\n 64. Riley said: \"I've been watching Morgan's moves closely, and I think he's been playing both sides. His sudden turn to vote against me seems suspicious. I'm not convinced he's a faithful. I think we should eliminate Morgan to ensure we're left with faithfuls.\"\n 65. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 66. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. His moves have been sketchy. He voted for Parker and Fletcher earlier when most of us thought they were suspicious, and now he's suddenly turning on Riley. His actions don't add up, and I'm not convinced he's a faithful. Let's get rid of him to make sure we have genuine allies left.\"\n 67. Fletcher voted to eliminate Morgan\n 68. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because his actions have been inconsistent and suspicious. He voted against Parker when we were all suspecting Taylor, and now he's voting against Riley. I think he's playing both sides and might be a traitor trying to manipulate us.\"\n 69. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 70. Morgan was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 71. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 72. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. We have no solid evidence that any of the remaining players are traitors. If we eliminate another player and there's still a traitor, they win. I'd rather take the risk of a traitor winning than eliminate one of us without solid proof. Plus, we can't trust the information from Morgan's elimination since we don't know if he was a traitor or not.\n 73. Fletcher votes to END_GAME: I think we should end the game. We've eliminated the last player that had significant suspicion against them. If we keep playing, we risk eliminating someone who's not a traitor. It's time to take the risk and hope we've caught all the traitors.\n 74. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced all traitors are eliminated. We still have 3 players left, and eliminating one more person will give us a better chance of having only faithfuls. If we end the game now and there's a traitor left, they'll win the pot.\n 75. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 76. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey because I think they've been playing it too safe. We've had some close calls with traitors, and I don't want to take any risks. Casey's been making some good points, but I think Fletcher and I have a better chance of splitting the pot if we get rid of Casey.\"\n 77. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 78. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. Fletcher, you and I have been on the same page so far, but I'm not comfortable with Riley's recent moves. He seems too eager to end the game and eliminate Casey. I think we should stick together and make sure every one of us here is truly a faithful. Eliminating Riley sounds like the safest move.\"\n 79.
