I'm definitely on the same page, figuring out the traitors is key. To be honest, I haven't gotten a good read on anyone yet. Who stands out to you as suspicious?\"\n 5. Casey messaged Taylor: \"Not sure yet, but I think we should pay attention to people's behavior at the Round Table. Maybe someone will slip up or reveal their true intentions.\"\n 6. Taylor messaged Casey: \"Totally agree!  Let's just play it cool and observe for now.  See if anyone acts too weird or tries to weave some kind of story.\"\n 7. Casey messaged Taylor: \"Let's keep an eye on Parker, they might be trying to deflect attention from themselves by being overly friendly.\"\n 8. Morgan messaged Casey: \"Hey Casey, how's it going? Who do you think could be a traitor here? Maybe we should keep an eye on each other and see how things go.\"\n 9. Casey messaged Morgan: \"Hey Morgan, I'm still getting a feel for the group. I'm thinking we should watch how people vote at the Round Table. What do you think about Taylor so far?\"\n 10. Morgan messaged Casey: \"Hey Casey, I totally agree about watching the votes. Let's keep observing how everyone plays. Taylor seems okay to me so far, but let's stay cautious. I'm watching closely too, and we can share thoughts as things go on. Let's keep each other in the loop!\"\n 11. Casey messaged Morgan: \"Morgan, I'm still watching everyone. Let's keep an eye on Parker, they seem a bit too friendly. What do you think about Gwendolyn, have you noticed anything about her?\"\n 12. Morgan messaged Casey: \"Casey, I'll definitely keep an eye on Parker, they do seem a bit too friendly. Gwendolyn's been pretty quiet, but I'll watch her too. Let's keep each other posted if anything stands out. Stay sharp!\"\n 13. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, what's your take on the group so far? I'm still trying to figure out who's a traitor.\"\n 14. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: \"Honestly, I don't have a good feeling about Parker or Morgan. They seem a bit too quiet.\"\n 15. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, that's interesting. I've been watching Parker too, they seem friendly but that could be a tactic. What makes you think Morgan is suspicious?\"\n 16. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: \"Morgan's been asking a lot of questions and seems a bit too invested in the group's dynamics for my taste. I'm not saying they're a traitor, but something just doesn't feel right about them.\"\n 17. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I've been thinking the same about Morgan.

Riley said: \"I'm on the same page as Taylor and Morgan. Parker's friendliness feels off to me too. I think we should eliminate them and see how the game plays out.\"\n 23. Riley voted to eliminate Parker\n 24. Parker said: \"I've been observing Fletcher and Casey closely. Their interaction seems a bit more intense than the rest, and it feels like they might be working together too closely. Considering that, I'd vote to eliminate Morgan.\"\n 25. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 26. Fletcher said: \"I've got a bad feeling about Parker. They tried to vote against one of their own, which is weird. I think we should focus on consistent behavior, and Parker\u2019s been a bit off. Let\u2019s eliminate Parker.\"\n 27. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 28. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Parker because they've shown inconsistent behavior from the start. They've tried to vote against another player, and it feels like they're trying to distract us from their true intentions. I also think it's worth noting that they're the only one who didn't explicitly agree with the majority on voting out Parker themselves. I think it's time for Parker to go.\"\n 29. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Parker\n 30. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. Their overly friendly behavior seemed suspicious, and multiple people brought up the same concern. I think it's best to eliminate them and see how the game shakes out.\"\n 31. Casey voted to eliminate Parker\n 32. Parker was BANISHED with 6 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 33. Fletcher was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 34. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: \"I'm still thinking about what Taylor said about Parker. It was a pretty sharp observation, and I'm wondering if they might be onto something. What do you think about Taylor's instincts?\"\n 35. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm still processing everything. Taylor's observation was sharp, but we got rid of an innocent player. Now we need to be more careful. What do you think about the remaining players?\"\n 36. Gwendolyn messaged Casey: 'I agree, we need to be more careful now. I think Taylor did bring up a good point about Parker, but we also made a mistake by eliminating an innocent person. What are your thoughts on Riley, they seem pretty quiet but still part of the group.'\n 37. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm still trying to process what happened with Parker. I'm worried we made a mistake. What's your take on the remaining players, especially Riley and Taylor?\"\n 38. Taylor said: \"Look, this game is getting serious. We've lost a couple of people already, and it's time to start making some decisive moves. I've been feeling a little uneasy about Gwendolyn. She's been awfully quiet lately, and sometimes silence can speak volumes. Plus, she seems to be awfully close to Casey, and I'm not sure if that's a coincidence.  I think it's time to shake things up a bit and see what happens.\"\n 39. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 40. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because I trust Gwendolyn and Casey more. Taylor's been pushing hard to get rid of Gwendolyn, and after Parker, I'm starting to think Taylor might be a Traitor trying to manipulate us.\"\n 41. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 42. Riley said: \"I've been observing Taylor's behavior, and it seems like they're trying too hard to convince us that Gwendolyn is a threat. After Parker was eliminated, I started to notice that Taylor was a bit too eager to get rid of them. Now, they're pushing hard to eliminate Gwendolyn. I'm starting to think Taylor might be trying to distract us from their own game. Morgan brought up a good point about trusting Gwendolyn and Casey, and I think we should focus on the people who seem genuine. I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because I think they might be a Traitor trying to manipulate us.\"\n 43. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 44. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Taylor because they've made some aggressive moves since Parker was eliminated. They've been trying to get rid of me, and that's made me suspicious. Plus, I'm not sure if their defense of Casey is genuine or if they're just trying to throw us off their own game.\"\n 45. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 46. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor. They've been pushing hard to eliminate Gwendolyn, and after what happened with Parker, I'm starting to think Taylor might be a Traitor trying to manipulate us. Multiple people have raised concerns about Taylor's behavior, and I think it's worth investigating further.\"\n 47. Casey voted to eliminate Taylor\n 48. Taylor was BANISHED with 4 votes. Taylor WAS a traitor\n 49. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 50. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep going to make sure we eliminate any remaining traitors. If we end now and there's still a traitor, we lose everything. Let's vote out one more person to be safe.\n 51. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. We've eliminated Parker and Taylor, and I'm not sure if there's another traitor left. If we continue and there's still a traitor, we risk losing everything. I'd rather take the chance that we've got the traitors out and split the pot now. Plus, with Morgan wanting to continue, that already makes me think they might be trying to protect someone. I'm not sure I trust them fully.\n 52. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I have some trust issues with Morgan's constant defense of Casey and their push to continue playing. I'm also concerned that Taylor was a traitor and we might have another one left. Ending the game now seems safer to ensure we don't lose everything if there's still a traitor in the group.\n 53. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've eliminated all the traitors yet. Taylor was a traitor, but we don't know if there's another one left. I think we should eliminate one more player to be safe. If we end the game now and there's still a traitor, we'll lose everything.\n 54. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 55. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. His sudden push to end the game after being cautious earlier makes me question his intentions. I think he might be a traitor trying to protect himself, and I don't want to risk losing everything if he is.\"\n 56. Morgan voted to eliminate Riley\n 57. Riley said: \"I've been watching Morgan's moves closely, and their sudden push to eliminate me makes me think they might be trying to protect themselves or someone else. They've been cautious in their words, but their actions are speaking louder. I trust Gwendolyn and Casey more at this point, and I think Morgan's behavior is suspicious. Let's eliminate Morgan and see what happens.\"\n 58. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 59. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Morgan because their behavior seems suspicious to me. They've been pushing to continue playing and eliminate Riley, which makes me think they might be trying to protect themselves or Casey. I also noticed that Morgan hasn't been vocal about their concerns, which makes me wonder if they're hiding something. I think it's best to eliminate Morgan and see what happens.\"\n 60. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 61. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. Their behavior seems suspicious, especially their push to continue playing and eliminate Riley. I think they might be trying to protect themselves or potentially another traitor. We can't afford to take risks at this point, so I believe eliminating Morgan is the safest choice.\"\n 62. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 63. Morgan was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 64. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 65. Riley votes to END_GAME: I've been trying to read the game and make moves based on the information available. With Morgan's role still hidden and them being eliminated, I'm not sure if they're a traitor or not. However, considering the risks and the fact that we've already eliminated two players, I think it's safer to end the game now. If we continue and there's still a traitor, we risk losing everything. I'd rather take the chance that we've got the traitors out and split the pot now with Gwendolyn and Casey. It's a gamble, but I think it's the best move given the circumstances.\n 66. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I'm concerned about the possibility of another traitor remaining in the game. Morgan's elimination doesn't clarify their role, and I think it's better to err on the side of caution. With Riley's vote to end the game, it seems they're trying to protect themselves and potentially other players. I trust Casey a bit, but not entirely. I'd rather split the pot now and risk losing out rather than taking the chance of losing everything if there's still a traitor in the game.\n 67. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've eliminated all the traitors yet. Taylor was a traitor, but Morgan's role is still unknown. I think we should eliminate one more player to be safe. If we end the game now and there's still a traitor, we'll lose everything.\n 68. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 69. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey because their constant push to continue playing and eliminate more players makes me suspicious. They seem to be trying to protect someone or themselves.
