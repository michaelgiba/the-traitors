Cassandra messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, it's been good so far!  Everyone seems pretty chill.  I'm not getting strong vibes from anyone yet, you know? It's early days. Kinda keeping an open mind for now.\"\n 5. Dominic messaged Cassandra: \"No worries, just trying to get a feel for everyone's dynamic. Beef and I were just chatting, he's got his eye on Ellis. Have you noticed anything off about them?\"\n 6. Cassandra messaged Dominic: \"Ooh, interesting!  I've actually had some brief chats with Ellis too, and yeah, they're definitely a bit... intense. I get what Beef's saying.  Hard to tell what they're truly thinking.\"\n 7. Dominic messaged Cassandra: \"I've got a similar vibe from Ellis. If we do suspect they're a traitor, we gotta be careful not to tip them off. Want to keep an eye on them together?\"\n 8. Alessandra said: \"I'm going to vote for Ellis. He's been really quiet, and I'm starting to wonder if he's hiding something. Maybe others have noticed it too.\"\n 9. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 10.

Sudz said: \"Dominic has been overly focused on his business, always buried in his phone or paperwork. He barely interacted during our discussions and it feels like he's trying to hide something. I think it's time to bring it out in the open and see if he knows something we're not.\"\n 13. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 14.

They\u2019re circling each other like vultures. I vote Sudz because they\u2019re pushing Dominic\u2019s buttons too much to be innocent.

Beef said: \"I'm voting for Sudz because they started drama with Dominic, and Ellis backed them up weirdly. Makes me think they're working together.\"\n 21. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 22. Fletcher said: \"Guys, I think we need to focus on the drama. Sudz keeps pointing fingers at Dominic, and now Ellis and Beef are on board too.

Taking him out removes a suspicious player and shifts focus away from other traitors.\n 28. Cassandra suggests murdering Ellis: Alessandra's suggestion makes a lot of sense. Ellis became way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated, trying to steer the narrative.  That's a big red flag for a potential flip. We need to take them out before they start getting suspicious of us.\n 29. Alessandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has become too vocal and could be a threat, so taking him out shifts focus and prevents suspicion.\n 30. Cassandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has been acting suspiciously.  He was quiet at first, then came out of nowhere to target Sudz.  That kind of sudden shift could mean he's trying to throw us off.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 32. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Cassandra, I'm so glad we took out Ellis. He was getting way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated. Let's keep the heat off us and take out anyone who starts getting too nosy. We need to keep the spotlight on others.\"\n 34. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Definitely agree, Alessandra.

Ellis became way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated, trying to steer the narrative.  That's a big red flag for a potential flip. We need to take them out before they start getting suspicious of us.\n 29. Alessandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has become too vocal and could be a threat, so taking him out shifts focus and prevents suspicion.\n 30. Cassandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has been acting suspiciously.  He was quiet at first, then came out of nowhere to target Sudz.  That kind of sudden shift could mean he's trying to throw us off.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 32. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33.

Ellis was getting a little too confident for his own good! It's important to stay under the radar and keep the game moving in our favor.Who do you think we should target next?\"\n 35.

We gotta stay on our toes, that's for sure.  Keep an eye on everyone, but I'm particularly watching Dominic. Seems like a lot of suspicion is falling on him right now. Don't you?\"\n 40. Braxton messaged Cassandra: \"Cassandra, you're spot on about Dominic. After Sudz's move, he definitely stands out as a key suspect. Let's keep our eyes on everyone, but let's focus on him for now and see if we can gather more info. Maybe we can discuss this during the next deliberations.\"\n 41. Cassandra messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton,  Dominic's definitely on my radar too. Seems like he's trying a little *too* hard to stay above it all. Maybe harmless, maybe not.

The drama with Sudz put a target on his back, and honestly, I'm starting to believe he might be hiding something. Let's eliminate him and keep moving forward without the drama.\"\n 44. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 45. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been acting awfully shifty ever since the Sudz drama erupted.  He's been trying to keep a low profile, but I can't shake this feeling that he knows something he's not telling us.

Taking her out now would help keep the spotlight off us and remove a potential danger.\n 59. Cassandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't made a strong impression.  He might be underestimated, allowing for less resistance if we eliminate him. It's better to be safe and get rid of a potential threat.\n 60. Alessandra votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been vocal and observant, making her a potential threat who could expose us. Removing her keeps the spotlight off the traitors.\n 61.

You're right, Sudz was definitely trying to stir the pot. Gwendolyn and Beef did seem pretty quick to jump on board with eliminating Sudz, didn't they? I'll keep an eye on them for sure.

They might have had their reasons for jumping on Sudz. Let's keep an eye on them, but maybe we should focus on someone else who's been quieter or acting off.

The drama with Sudz put a target on his back, and honestly, I'm starting to believe he might be hiding something. Let's eliminate him and keep moving forward without the drama.\"\n 39. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been acting awfully shifty ever since the Sudz drama erupted.

Taking her out now would help keep the spotlight off us and remove a potential danger.\n 54. Cassandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't made a strong impression.  He might be underestimated, allowing for less resistance if we eliminate him. It's better to be safe and get rid of a potential threat.\n 55.

You seemed pretty convinced to eliminate Sudz, what made you think they were the one?\"\n 24. Fletcher messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, yeah, Sudz's behavior was off. Constantly targeting Dominic you, made me think something was fishy. Ellis and Beef agreeing to vote Sudz out made me feel more confident. Let's keep an eye on everyone, especially after this turn of events.\"\n 25. Dominic messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, now that Sudz is out, I'm still trying to figure out who the other traitor is. You seemed pretty sure about Sudz, but now I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on Gwendolyn or Beef. They were pretty quick to eliminate Sudz, and I'm not sure if they're in the clear yet.\"\n 26.

Braxton does seem a bit off now that Dominic's gone. His vote against Beef was kind of random. Maybe he's hiding something? We should keep a close eye on him just in case.

We don't want any surprises here. \ud83d\ude0a\"\n 47. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Agreed, Braxton's move was odd. Let's observe more but be careful not to start doubting everyone. Keep our alliance strong and watch for any more shifts.\"\n 48. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, we need to be extra cautious. Since Gwendolyn was just murdered, there are still traitors among us. Let's keep an eye on anyone who seems too eager to shift suspicion away from themselves. I've noticed some inconsistent voting patterns that don't add up. We should discuss these observations during the next deliberations and focus on eliminating the real threats.\"\n 49. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I agree. We need to keep our guards up. The murders show there are still traitors here. Let's watch out for anyone deflecting suspicion too much, like they're protecting themselves. Let's stick together and be smart about our votes.\"\n 50.

That kind of sudden shift could mean he's trying to throw us off.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 32. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33.

Taking her out now would help keep the spotlight off us and remove a potential danger.\n 59. Cassandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't made a strong impression.  He might be underestimated, allowing for less resistance if we eliminate him. It's better to be safe and get rid of a potential threat.\n 60. Alessandra votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been vocal and observant, making her a potential threat who could expose us. Removing her keeps the spotlight off the traitors.\n 61.

Beef said: \"I'm voting for Sudz because they started drama with Dominic, and Ellis backed them up weirdly. Makes me think they're working together.\"\n 16. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17.

That seems a bit suspicious, so let's check Sudz out first.\"\n 18. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"Sudz, I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about some of your actions. You've been stirring the pot and suggesting that others might be hiding something, but when the spotlight's on you, you seem to be getting defensive.

Sudz was BANISHED with 5 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 22. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 23. Dominic messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, what's your take on the last round? Sudz being a traitor was a surprise. Now that they're gone, I'm trying to figure out who else might be hiding something. You seemed pretty convinced to eliminate Sudz, what made you think they were the one?\"\n 24. Fletcher messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, yeah, Sudz's behavior was off. Constantly targeting Dominic you, made me think something was fishy. Ellis and Beef agreeing to vote Sudz out made me feel more confident. Let's keep an eye on everyone, especially after this turn of events.\"\n 25. Dominic messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, now that Sudz is out, I'm still trying to figure out who the other traitor is. You seemed pretty sure about Sudz, but now I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on Gwendolyn or Beef. They were pretty quick to eliminate Sudz, and I'm not sure if they're in the clear yet.\"\n 26. Fletcher messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, I still trust Beef and Gwendolyn for now. They've been straightforward. I think we should stay united against other suspicious players. Let's keep this low profile and observe more.\"\n 27. Dominic messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I appreciate your trust in Beef and Gwendolyn, but I'm still getting a weird vibe from them. What if we're missing something? Maybe we should dig a bit deeper without making them suspicious?\"\n 28. Alessandra said: \"I think Dominic has become a liability. The drama with Sudz put a target on his back, and honestly, I'm starting to believe he might be hiding something. Let's eliminate him and keep moving forward without the drama.\"\n 29. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 30. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been acting awfully shifty ever since the Sudz drama erupted.  He's been trying to keep a low profile, but I can't shake this feeling that he knows something he's not telling us.  We need to cut our losses and get rid of him before he can cause any more trouble.\"\n 31. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 32.

It feels like she's trying to build a case against me without any real evidence. I'm starting to think she might be trying to distract us from something or someone else. I think we should take a closer look at her and see if she's hiding something.\"\n 35. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 36. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Cassandra because she's been making accusations against Dominic without solid evidence, and it seems like she's trying to distract us.

Braxton does seem a bit off now that Dominic's gone. His vote against Beef was kind of random. Maybe he's hiding something? We should keep a close eye on him just in case.

We don't want any surprises here. \ud83d\ude0a\"\n 47. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Agreed, Braxton's move was odd. Let's observe more but be careful not to start doubting everyone. Keep our alliance strong and watch for any more shifts.\"\n 48. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, we need to be extra cautious. Since Gwendolyn was just murdered, there are still traitors among us. Let's keep an eye on anyone who seems too eager to shift suspicion away from themselves. I've noticed some inconsistent voting patterns that don't add up. We should discuss these observations during the next deliberations and focus on eliminating the real threats.\"\n 49. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I agree. We need to keep our guards up. The murders show there are still traitors here. Let's watch out for anyone deflecting suspicion too much, like they're protecting themselves. Let's stick together and be smart about our votes.\"\n 50. Cassandra messaged Fletcher: 'Yo Fletcher, this game is intense, right?  Seems like things are heating up! Who do you think is playing a good game so far?'\n 51. Fletcher messaged Cassandra: \"Yeah, it's really turning up the heat! I think everyone's on their toes, but Braxton's sudden vote against Beef was odd. I think we need to watch everyone's moves closely, especially Braxton's, but also not jump to conclusions.\"\n 52. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because his unexpected vote against Beef raises some red flags. That kind of randomness can be really dangerous in this game, and I think it's better to eliminate that risk now before it comes back to haunt us.\"\n 53. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 54. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote for Braxton. His sudden shift and unpredictable vote against Beef feels a little too suspicious for me. It might be innocent, but in this game, we have to prioritize safety and consider the bigger picture. Braxton's sudden move makes him a wildcard, and I think it's best to eliminate that uncertainty right now.\"\n 55. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 56. Braxton said: \"I'm voting for Beef. His erratic behavior and inconsistent voting patterns raise red flags. We need someone stable we can trust moving forward.\"\n 57. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 58.

We need to be careful about who's playing the game smartly and who's just playing it safe by targeting others randomly.\"\n 59. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 60. Fletcher said: \"Guys, Braxton's vote against Beef was really out of the blue and it\u2019s making me suspicious. We need to eliminate anyone who might be using unpredictable moves to distract us.

With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 65. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: With three players left and being a traitor, ending the game ensures that the traitors win without further risk.\n 66. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we need to be sure before we end the game. If we end it and there's still a traitor left, we get nothing. Better to root out anyone suspicious first and ensure we're safe to end the game.\n 67. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: It's a calculated risk, but with only three players left, the odds are heavily in our favor.  If Alessandra and I stick together and ensure Fletcher is out, we win.

Sudz said: \"Dominic has been overly focused on his business, always buried in his phone or paperwork. He barely interacted during our discussions and it feels like he's trying to hide something. I think it's time to bring it out in the open and see if he knows something we're not.\"\n 13. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 14.

Ellis became way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated, trying to steer the narrative.  That's a big red flag for a potential flip. We need to take them out before they start getting suspicious of us.\n 29. Alessandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has become too vocal and could be a threat, so taking him out shifts focus and prevents suspicion.\n 30.

She might become a bigger threat if she keeps observing and could potentially figure out who the traitors are. Taking her out now would help keep the spotlight off us and remove a potential danger.\n 59. Cassandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't made a strong impression.  He might be underestimated, allowing for less resistance if we eliminate him. It's better to be safe and get rid of a potential threat.\n 60. Alessandra votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been vocal and observant, making her a potential threat who could expose us. Removing her keeps the spotlight off the traitors.\n 61.

'Alessandra' selected as a traitor.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Alessandra', 'Beef', 'Braxton', 'Cassandra', 'Dominic', 'Ellis', 'Fletcher', 'Gwendolyn', 'Sudz']\n 3. Alessandra said: \"I'm going to vote for Ellis. He's been really quiet, and I'm starting to wonder if he's hiding something. Maybe others have noticed it too.\"\n 4. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 5. Cassandra said: \"I gotta agree with Alessandra here. Ellis has been awfully quiet, and it's making me uneasy. We need to get to the bottom of things, and I think it's time to see if Ellis has something to hide.\"\n 6. Cassandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 7. Sudz said: \"Dominic has been overly focused on his business, always buried in his phone or paperwork. He barely interacted during our discussions and it feels like he's trying to hide something. I think it's time to bring it out in the open and see if he knows something we're not.\"\n 8. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 9. Braxton said: \"After considering the discussions, I'll vote to eliminate Ellis. While I don't have concrete evidence, the fact that others share suspicions makes it a cautious choice to support the group's collective judgment.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Ellis\n 11. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Sudz. They just threw a curveball by suggesting I might be hiding something. Feels like a deflection tactic to me. Let's see if they're the one hiding something.\"\n 12. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Ellis said: 'Let\u2019s cut the drama between Dominic and Sudz already. They\u2019re circling each other like vultures. I vote Sudz because they\u2019re pushing Dominic\u2019s buttons too much to be innocent. We need to flush out the real traitors instead of dancing around this.'\n 14. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Sudz because they started drama with Dominic, and Ellis backed them up weirdly. Makes me think they're working together.\"\n 16. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17. Fletcher said: \"Guys, I think we need to focus on the drama. Sudz keeps pointing fingers at Dominic, and now Ellis and Beef are on board too. That seems a bit suspicious, so let's check Sudz out first.\"\n 18. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"Sudz, I have to say, I'm a bit concerned about some of your actions. You've been stirring the pot and suggesting that others might be hiding something, but when the spotlight's on you, you seem to be getting defensive. I'm not saying you are a traitor, but I do think you're being disingenuous and that's not someone I'd want to trust in this game.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 21. Sudz was BANISHED with 5 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 22. Alessandra suggests murdering Ellis: Ellis was quiet early on but became vocal against Sudz, making him a potential threat. Taking him out removes a suspicious player and shifts focus away from other traitors.\n 23. Cassandra suggests murdering Ellis: Alessandra's suggestion makes a lot of sense. Ellis became way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated, trying to steer the narrative.  That's a big red flag for a potential flip. We need to take them out before they start getting suspicious of us.\n 24. Alessandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has become too vocal and could be a threat, so taking him out shifts focus and prevents suspicion.\n 25. Cassandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis has been acting suspiciously.  He was quiet at first, then came out of nowhere to target Sudz.  That kind of sudden shift could mean he's trying to throw us off.\n 26. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 27. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Cassandra, I'm so glad we took out Ellis. He was getting way too vocal after Sudz was eliminated. Let's keep the heat off us and take out anyone who starts getting too nosy. We need to keep the spotlight on others.\"\n 29. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Definitely agree, Alessandra.  Ellis was getting a little too confident for his own good! It's important to stay under the radar and keep the game moving in our favor.Who do you think we should target next?\"\n 30. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Cassandra, let's go after Dominic next. He's already under suspicion from the Sudz drama, and taking him out will keep the spotlight off us. Plus, he's a faithful, so it's a smart move to reduce their numbers.\"\n 31. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"I like that, Alessandra. Dominic's definitely got a target on his back right now.  Let's keep pushing that narrative and see if we can make it stick.  We need to be ruthless right now and eliminate anyone who looks like a potential leader.\"\n 32. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Cassandra, Dominic is definitely our next target. He's under suspicion already, and taking him out will keep the spotlight off us. Plus, he's a faithful, so it's a smart move to reduce their numbers. Let's keep pushing that narrative and make it happen.\"\n 33. Alessandra messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, I know things got heated with Sudz, but now that Sudz is gone, I'm noticing people are starting to eye you because of all that drama. I get why you defended yourself, but we need to make sure you're not the next target. What's really going on?\"\n 34. Dominic messaged Alessandra: \"Thanks for looking out for me, Alessandra. I think Sudz was trying to throw me off, but now that they're gone, I'm a bit worried about who the other traitors are. You and I seem to be on the same page so far. Want to keep an eye on Gwendolyn and Beef? They seemed pretty on board with taking out Sudz, might be worth watching.\"\n 35. Alessandra messaged Dominic: \"I totally get why you're worried, Dominic. You're right, Sudz was definitely trying to stir the pot. Gwendolyn and Beef did seem pretty quick to jump on board with eliminating Sudz, didn't they? I'll keep an eye on them for sure. Let's make sure we're looking out for each other.\"\n 36. Dominic messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, thanks for sticking up for me. Now that Sudz is out, I think we should focus on Gwendolyn and Beef. They were really quick to defend Sudz's accusations against me. Maybe we can get more info from them without making them suspicious?\"\n 37. Alessandra messaged Dominic: \"I see where you're coming from with Gwendolyn and Beef, but let's not jump to conclusions. They might have had their reasons for jumping on Sudz. Let's keep an eye on them, but maybe we should focus on someone else who's been quieter or acting off. Let's not make any moves yet and see how things play out a bit more.\"\n 38. Alessandra said: \"I think Dominic has become a liability. The drama with Sudz put a target on his back, and honestly, I'm starting to believe he might be hiding something. Let's eliminate him and keep moving forward without the drama.\"\n 39. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been acting awfully shifty ever since the Sudz drama erupted.  He's been trying to keep a low profile, but I can't shake this feeling that he knows something he's not telling us.  We need to cut our losses and get rid of him before he can cause any more trouble.\"\n 41. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Braxton said: \"I've noticed Beef's behavior has been erratic and suspicious. We need to eliminate the threat before it's too late.\"\n 43. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 44. Dominic said: \"I've been noticing Cassandra has been making some pretty strong accusations against me, and now she's voting to eliminate me. It feels like she's trying to build a case against me without any real evidence. I'm starting to think she might be trying to distract us from something or someone else. I think we should take a closer look at her and see if she's hiding something.\"\n 45. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 46. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Cassandra because she's been making accusations against Dominic without solid evidence, and it seems like she's trying to distract us. Her behavior is suspicious and could be a traitor's tactic.\"\n 47. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 48. Fletcher said: \"Guys, Dominic's behavior is starting to worry me. He's been trying to deflect attention from himself, especially after the vote on Sudz. I think we need to take a closer look at him to keep the team safe.\"\n 49. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Dominic, I think you've been trying to deflect attention from yourself since the start. Your behavior has been suspicious and it feels like you're hiding something. With Sudz out of the picture, it feels like you're the next one who could be hiding something. I think we need to get rid of you and keep the team safe.\"\n 51. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 52. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 53. Alessandra suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been pretty vocal and seems to be paying close attention to others. She might become a bigger threat if she keeps observing and could potentially figure out who the traitors are. Taking her out now would help keep the spotlight off us and remove a potential danger.\n 54. Cassandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't made a strong impression.  He might be underestimated, allowing for less resistance if we eliminate him. It's better to be safe and get rid of a potential threat.\n 55. Alessandra votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been vocal and observant, making her a potential threat who could expose us. Removing her keeps the spotlight off the traitors.\n 56. Cassandra votes to murder Fletcher: It's better to eliminate someone who might be underestimated. Fletcher has been quiet and hasn't stood out. This could be our chance to take him out with little resistance.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Gwendolyn\n 58. Gwendolyn was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I think we're making good progress, but the murders are still happening. We need to stay alert. What do you think about Braxton now that Dominic's out?\"\n 60. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"I know what you mean about the murders. It's getting intense. Braxton does seem a bit off now that Dominic's gone. His vote against Beef was kind of random. Maybe he's hiding something? We should keep a close eye on him just in case. Let's stay vigilant! \ud83d\ude0a\"\n 61. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"I totally agree with you, Fletcher. The murders are keeping everyone on edge, and we can't let our guard down. Braxton is definitely someone to watch closely\u2014his vote against Beef was unexpected and raises some questions. Let's keep a close eye on him and stay alert. We don't want any surprises here. \ud83d\ude0a\"\n 62. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Agreed, Braxton's move was odd. Let's observe more but be careful not to start doubting everyone. Keep our alliance strong and watch for any more shifts.\"\n 63. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because his unexpected vote against Beef raises some red flags. That kind of randomness can be really dangerous in this game, and I think it's better to eliminate that risk now before it comes back to haunt us.\"\n 64. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 65. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote for Braxton. His sudden shift and unpredictable vote against Beef feels a little too suspicious for me. It might be innocent, but in this game, we have to prioritize safety and consider the bigger picture. Braxton's sudden move makes him a wildcard, and I think it's best to eliminate that uncertainty right now.\"\n 66. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 67. Braxton said: \"I'm voting for Beef. His erratic behavior and inconsistent voting patterns raise red flags. We need someone stable we can trust moving forward.\"\n 68. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 69. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton because his vote against me was out of left field and raised some red flags. We need to be careful about who's playing the game smartly and who's just playing it safe by targeting others randomly.\"\n 70. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 71. Fletcher said: \"Guys, Braxton's vote against Beef was really out of the blue and it\u2019s making me suspicious. We need to eliminate anyone who might be using unpredictable moves to distract us. Let's take Braxton out.\"\n 72. Fletcher voted to eliminate Braxton\n 73. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 74. Alessandra suggests murdering Beef: Beef has been active and could become a bigger threat, so eliminating him now reduces risks.\n 75. Cassandra suggests murdering Beef: Beef has been vocal and has survived several rounds. He's becoming more of a target for the faithful to vote for, and our best move is to eliminate him before he exposes us.\n 76. Alessandra votes to murder Beef: Beef has been active and could become a bigger threat, so eliminating him now reduces risks.\n 77. Cassandra votes to murder Beef: Beef is a growing threat, has been vocal, and is probably targeted by the faithful. Eliminating him now keeps us safe.\n 78. The traitors have decided to murder Beef\n 79. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 80. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 81. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: With three players left and being a traitor, ending the game ensures that the traitors win without further risk.\n 82. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we need to be sure before we end the game. If we end it and there's still a traitor left, we get nothing. Better to root out anyone suspicious first and ensure we're safe to end the game.\n 83. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: It's a calculated risk, but with only three players left, the odds are heavily in our favor.  If Alessandra and I stick together and ensure Fletcher is out, we win. Continung further risks exposure and lets Fletcher possibly outwit us.\n 84. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 85. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra. Her eagerness to end the game and her focus on eliminating others quickly makes me think she's trying to rush to a win. We need to be sure we're not leaving any traitor in the pool. Let's take her out to make sure we're safe.\"\n 86. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 87. Cassandra said: \"Fletcher, you've been awfully quiet, but I feel like your sudden interest in preserving the game all of a sudden is just a way to  throw us off.  You need to be put back in your place. The fact that you\u2019re urging me to go with your game is too much trust. We need to eliminate the risk. \"\n 88.
