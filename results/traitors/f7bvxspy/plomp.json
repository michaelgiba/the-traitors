Ellis messaged Cassandra: 'Hey Cass, I\u2019m definitely keeping my guard up\u2014those traitors could be anyone. Think we should stick together? Maybe compare notes on who\u2019s acting shady at the table. If we trust each other, we can vote smart later.'\n 4. Cassandra messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, you're on the right track! I'm totally with you on being cautious. I'll definitely keep my eyes peeled for anything suspicious.  Let's compare notes for sure. Strong alliances could be key!\"\n 5. Alessandra said: \"I think we should vote out Beef. He's been acting really shady, trying to form alliances too quickly. That kind of behavior makes me think he might be a traitor. Let's eliminate him to protect ourselves.\"\n 6. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 7. Dominic said: \"I think Beef is being really sneaky, trying to make friends with everyone at once. It's making me think he's hiding something. Let's get rid of him to be safe.\"\n 8. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 9. Braxton said: \"I agree with Alessandra and Dominic. Beef's behavior seems off\u2014forming alliances too quickly. Let's eliminate him to protect our group.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 11. Cassandra said: \"I'm with the rest of the group here. Beef's trying to make a ton of friends super fast, and that feels sus to me. I think it's time we send him home.\"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Ellis said: \"Alright, I'm with the group\u2014Beef's move to partner with everyone too fast is super sketch. We need to trust this collective instinct. Let's vote Beef out to keep the group safe!\"\n 14. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 15. Sudz said: \"Dominic has been consistently dismissive and defensive in our discussions. I haven't seen him actively contributing or supporting the group. His lack of transparency and reluctance to share information make me question his loyalty. I believe Dominic might be a traitor.\"\n 16. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 17. Beef said: \"Alessandra's been leading the charge to eliminate me, and I think she's trying to get rid of people she thinks are threats. She's too controlling, and I don't trust her.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 19. Beef was BANISHED with 5 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 20. Sudz was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 21. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I'm so shocked about Sudz. I thought they were one of us. Now I'm even more confused about who the traitors are. Maybe we should look closely at Dominic; they've been quiet and I'm not sure if I can trust them completely.\"\n 22. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I'm with you. Sudz's murder was a huge blow. I'm definitely keeping a closer eye on Dominic now. Their silence is definitely sus. We need to figure out who else to trust.\"\n 23. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Agreed.  Dominic's been acting strange.  We need to figure out if they're hiding something.  Maybe we can try to bait them into saying something suspicious?\"\n 24. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I totally get why you're suspicious of Dominic, Cassandra. Their quiet behavior is definitely a red flag. Maybe we should bring this up at the round table and see how everyone else feels. It's better if we all discuss it together to make sure we're on the same page.\"\n 25. Alessandra said: \"I think Dominic has been way too quiet and not contributing much. That makes me suspicious. Let's eliminate him to be safe.\"\n 26. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 27. Dominic said: \"Alessandra's been gunning for me hard, and now she's trying to eliminate me. I think she's trying to take out the competition. Her behavior is suspicious, and I don't trust her.\"\n 28. Dominic voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 29. Braxton said: \"I think Alessandra has been way too eager to eliminate people. She's always pointing fingers and making accusations. I don't trust her. Let's eliminate her to keep our group safe.\"\n 30. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 31. Cassandra said: \"I'm starting to think Dominic is playing both sides. Their constant silence and avoidance of group discussions are really suspicious. They haven't been open or helpful, and in a game like this, transparency is key. I think it's time we vote Dominic out and see if they were hiding something.\"\n 32. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 33. Ellis said: 'Dominic\u2019s silence and deflection after Sudz\u2019s murder scream guilty. His sudden paranoia about being targeted? That\u2019s exactly how a traitor acts when caught. I\u2019m voting Dominic out now to protect us from whoever\u2019s manipulating this group.'\n 34. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 35. Dominic was BANISHED with 3 votes. Dominic WAS a traitor\n 36. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 37. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 38. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: I think we've handled the main threats and it's time to secure the prize. Let's end the game.\n 39. Braxton votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't trust we've caught all the traitors yet. Continuing gives us a chance to eliminate more suspects and make sure we're safe before ending.\n 40. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: While I trust Alessandra,  Braxton's vote to continue makes me nervous.  There's a chance there's another traitor, and continuing risks getting eliminated if I'm wrong.  It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it on ending the game and hoping we've eliminated everyone.\n 41. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 42. Alessandra said: \"I think Braxton is more of a wild card and has shown he's willing to go against me. To keep things safer and more controlled, I vote to eliminate Braxton.\"\n 43. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 44. Braxton said: \"I vote to eliminate Alessandra.
