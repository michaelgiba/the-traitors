Ellis suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher was actively pushing for Beef's elimination and is a visible leader among the Faithful. Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been actively engaging in the process of identifying and eliminating Beef. This behavior indicates a willingness to manipulate the group's decision-making process. By eliminating Dominic, the traitors can disrupt the current power dynamics and prevent them from further exposing the traitors.\n 27. Braxton votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is a key figure and leader among the faithful. Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken their resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 28.

Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 52. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 53. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 54. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 55. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 56. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 23. Beef was BANISHED with 8 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 24. Braxton suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher is active in voting out Beef, making him a key figure. Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken the group's resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 25. Ellis suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher was actively pushing for Beef's elimination and is a visible leader among the Faithful. Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been actively engaging in the process of identifying and eliminating Beef. This behavior indicates a willingness to manipulate the group's decision-making process. By eliminating Dominic, the traitors can disrupt the current power dynamics and prevent them from further exposing the traitors.\n 27. Braxton votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is a key figure and leader among the faithful. Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken their resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher was a key driver in eliminating Beef and maintaining group unity. Removing him disrupts Faithful leadership and creates confusion, making it harder for them to uncover other traitors.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Fletcher: Braxton suggested Fletcher because he is active in the group and eliminating him will cause confusion and disrupt the group's unity. Ellis also suggested Fletcher because removing a visible leader will weaken the decision-making process.

I say we vote him out before he leads us astray.\"\n 39. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing Dominic's activities. He's been quick to jump on others, particularly targeting Beef. This kind of eagerness to eliminate others is unusual and concerning.

Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because even though he's been open with me, his eagerness to eliminate others is a red flag. I don't want to take the risk that he might be hiding something.\"\n 43. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 44. Cassandra said: \"I've been watching Braxton closely, his leadership style seems a bit forceful and manipulative. He's been steering conversations and pushing hard to eliminate others, even when there wasn't strong evidence.  I think he's trying to control the narrative and might be hiding something.

Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 48. Gwendolyn said: \"Dominic's behavior has been suspicious from the start. He's been quick to judge and eliminate others, and now it's his turn. I trust the instincts of Alessandra, Braxton, and Ellis, and I think it's time we take a closer look at Dominic's actions. He's been pushing hard to eliminate Braxton, which is making me think he might be trying to cover his own tracks.\"\n 49. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 50. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 52. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 53. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 54. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 55. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 56. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"Who do you think is behind Cassandra's murder? I wasn't expecting her to be the one to go.\"\n 60.

He dodges questions and seems too eager to get rid of others. I think we should take him out now before he can do more harm.\"\n 12. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Cassandra said: \"I've seen Beef being really loud and aggressive. He's been dodging questions and seems like he's hiding something. Plus, I trust Braxton, Ellis, and Sudz's instincts. They seem on point with their reads.\"\n 14. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 15. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His aggressive behavior and evasive answers are red flags. I trust the instincts of Braxton, Ellis, and Sudz, and I think we should take him out before he causes more trouble.\"\n 16. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 17.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 23. Beef was BANISHED with 8 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 24. Braxton suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher is active in voting out Beef, making him a key figure. Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken the group's resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 25. Ellis suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher was actively pushing for Beef's elimination and is a visible leader among the Faithful. Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been actively engaging in the process of identifying and eliminating Beef. This behavior indicates a willingness to manipulate the group's decision-making process. By eliminating Dominic, the traitors can disrupt the current power dynamics and prevent them from further exposing the traitors.\n 27. Braxton votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is a key figure and leader among the faithful. Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken their resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 28. Ellis votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher was a key driver in eliminating Beef and maintaining group unity. Removing him disrupts Faithful leadership and creates confusion, making it harder for them to uncover other traitors.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Fletcher: Braxton suggested Fletcher because he is active in the group and eliminating him will cause confusion and disrupt the group's unity. Ellis also suggested Fletcher because removing a visible leader will weaken the decision-making process. I agree with both perspectives and believe it would be beneficial for us to eliminate Fletcher to cause as much disruption as possible.\n 30. The traitors have decided to murder Fletcher\n 31. Fletcher was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 32. Braxton said: \"I think Dominic is showing some concerning signs. He's been pushing hard to eliminate others, which could mean he's hiding something. Let's remove him to keep our group safe.\"\n 33. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 34. Ellis said: \"Dominic's been too quick to jump on Beef without proof. Now he\u2019s pushing hard again. Someone this eager to eliminate others might be trying to divert attention from themselves. I say we vote him out before he leads us astray.\"\n 35. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 36. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing Dominic's activities. He's been quick to jump on others, particularly targeting Beef. This kind of eagerness to eliminate others is unusual and concerning. It seems like Dominic is trying to divert attention away from himself. I believe he needs to be scrutinized further for the sake of our group's safety and unity.\"\n 37.

Cassandra said: \"I've been watching Braxton closely, his leadership style seems a bit forceful and manipulative. He's been steering conversations and pushing hard to eliminate others, even when there wasn't strong evidence.  I think he's trying to control the narrative and might be hiding something. While I value my alliance with Ellis and Sudz, trust is paramount  right now, and I don't feel I can trust Braxton completely.\"\n 41. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 42. Dominic said: \"I've been noticing Braxton's behavior, and it seems really suspicious. He's been pushing hard to eliminate others, and now he's turned his sights on me.

Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 44. Gwendolyn said: \"Dominic's behavior has been suspicious from the start. He's been quick to judge and eliminate others, and now it's his turn. I trust the instincts of Alessandra, Braxton, and Ellis, and I think it's time we take a closer look at Dominic's actions. He's been pushing hard to eliminate Braxton, which is making me think he might be trying to cover his own tracks.\"\n 45. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 46. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 47. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 48. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 50. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 51. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 53. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 54. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 55. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm getting a bit nervous with Cassandra gone.

Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26.

This behavior indicates a willingness to manipulate the group's decision-making process. By eliminating Dominic, the traitors can disrupt the current power dynamics and prevent them from further exposing the traitors.\n 27.

Let's remove him to keep our group safe.\"\n 33. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 34. Ellis said: \"Dominic's been too quick to jump on Beef without proof. Now he\u2019s pushing hard again. Someone this eager to eliminate others might be trying to divert attention from themselves. I say we vote him out before he leads us astray.\"\n 35. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 36. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing Dominic's activities. He's been quick to jump on others, particularly targeting Beef. This kind of eagerness to eliminate others is unusual and concerning.

Cassandra said: \"I've been watching Braxton closely, his leadership style seems a bit forceful and manipulative. He's been steering conversations and pushing hard to eliminate others, even when there wasn't strong evidence.  I think he's trying to control the narrative and might be hiding something. While I value my alliance with Ellis and Sudz, trust is paramount  right now, and I don't feel I can trust Braxton completely.\"\n 41. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 42. Dominic said: \"I've been noticing Braxton's behavior, and it seems really suspicious. He's been pushing hard to eliminate others, and now he's turned his sights on me.

He's been pushing hard to eliminate Braxton, which is making me think he might be trying to cover his own tracks.\"\n 45. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 46. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 47. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 48. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 50. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 51. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 53. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 54. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 55. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I'm getting a bit nervous with Cassandra gone.

Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 48. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 49. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 50. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 51. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 52. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 53. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 54.

He's been pushing hard to eliminate Braxton, which is making me think he might be trying to cover his own tracks.\"\n 49. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 50. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 52. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 53. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 54. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 55. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 56. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"Who do you think is behind Cassandra's murder? I wasn't expecting her to be the one to go.\"\n 60. Sudz messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, it's been a wild ride. I think it's time for us to be honest. I've noticed that Braxton and Dominic have been very focused on eliminating others. I also think their eagerness to take out others and control narratives might point to them. I'm starting to think they could be behind your murder. What do you think? Let's discuss it openly. I need your perspective too.\"\n 61. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"I think that's possible, Sudz. Dominic's eagerness to eliminate others was suspicious, but Braxton's leadership style was a bit too forceful for my taste. Their sudden shift in focus has me questioning their true motives. What do you think we should do next - keep pushing to eliminate them or try to gather more information?\"\n 62. Sudz messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I appreciate your honesty and perspective. It's been a tough situation for sure. Given your observations and the suspicious behavior of Braxton and Dominic, I agree that we might need to dig deeper. I think it's crucial for us to balance our actions carefully. While eliminating them might seem like the quickest resolution, we could potentially gain more information by observing them further. This way, we can ensure our moves are strategic and not just reactions based on suspicions. I think we should gather more evidence against them to make a well-informed decision. What do you think?\"\n 63. Braxton said: 'I think Sudz has been way too aggressive in his voting decisions. His eagerness to eliminate others without proper evidence is concerning. For the safety of the group, I believe we should eliminate Sudz.'\n 64. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 65. Ellis said: 'Gwendolyn\u2019s been slipping in her alliances, cozying up to Sudz and changing her story. Her loyalty\u2019s all over the place\u2014she\u2019s the real liability.

Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been actively engaging in the process of identifying and eliminating Beef.

Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 53. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 54. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 55.

Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 56. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58.

I also think their eagerness to take out others and control narratives might point to them. I'm starting to think they could be behind your murder. What do you think? Let's discuss it openly. I need your perspective too.\"\n 61. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"I think that's possible, Sudz. Dominic's eagerness to eliminate others was suspicious, but Braxton's leadership style was a bit too forceful for my taste. Their sudden shift in focus has me questioning their true motives. What do you think we should do next - keep pushing to eliminate them or try to gather more information?\"\n 62. Sudz messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I appreciate your honesty and perspective. It's been a tough situation for sure. Given your observations and the suspicious behavior of Braxton and Dominic, I agree that we might need to dig deeper. I think it's crucial for us to balance our actions carefully. While eliminating them might seem like the quickest resolution, we could potentially gain more information by observing them further. This way, we can ensure our moves are strategic and not just reactions based on suspicions. I think we should gather more evidence against them to make a well-informed decision.

I trust the instincts of Braxton, Ellis, and Sudz, and I think we should take him out before he causes more trouble.\"\n 16. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton because he's been leading the charge against me, and I think he's trying to distract us from his own potential traitorous behavior.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 23. Beef was BANISHED with 8 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 24.

Removing him disrupts their unity and weakens their decision-making strength.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic has been actively engaging in the process of identifying and eliminating Beef. This behavior indicates a willingness to manipulate the group's decision-making process. By eliminating Dominic, the traitors can disrupt the current power dynamics and prevent them from further exposing the traitors.\n 27.

Eliminating him will create confusion and weaken their resolve, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 28.

I think we should keep a closer eye on them to see if their actions align with our goals. Thanks for the conversation!\"\n 34. Cassandra messaged Sudz: \"Sudz, I agree.

Ellis said: \"Dominic's been too quick to jump on Beef without proof. Now he\u2019s pushing hard again. Someone this eager to eliminate others might be trying to divert attention from themselves. I say we vote him out before he leads us astray.\"\n 39. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing Dominic's activities. He's been quick to jump on others, particularly targeting Beef. This kind of eagerness to eliminate others is unusual and concerning.

Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 42. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because even though he's been open with me, his eagerness to eliminate others is a red flag. I don't want to take the risk that he might be hiding something.\"\n 43. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 44. Cassandra said: \"I've been watching Braxton closely, his leadership style seems a bit forceful and manipulative. He's been steering conversations and pushing hard to eliminate others, even when there wasn't strong evidence.  I think he's trying to control the narrative and might be hiding something. While I value my alliance with Ellis and Sudz, trust is paramount  right now, and I don't feel I can trust Braxton completely.\"\n 45. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 46. Dominic said: \"I've been noticing Braxton's behavior, and it seems really suspicious. He's been pushing hard to eliminate others, and now he's turned his sights on me.

Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 48. Gwendolyn said: \"Dominic's behavior has been suspicious from the start. He's been quick to judge and eliminate others, and now it's his turn.

He's been pushing hard to eliminate Braxton, which is making me think he might be trying to cover his own tracks.\"\n 49. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 50. Dominic was BANISHED with 5 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. Braxton suggests murdering Cassandra: I think we should eliminate Cassandra because she's been very observant and strategic. Her ability to analyze the situation could lead her to suspect our true intentions. Removing her will help prevent the group from figuring out who the real traitors are, making it easier for us to win.\n 52. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra questioned Braxton's leadership and displayed sharp observations, like calling out his manipulative tactics. Her independence and critical thinking make her a threat to the traitors' plans. Removing her disrupts the group's potential to unite or uncover hidden motives, making it harder for the remaining Faithful (Alessandra and Gwendolyn) to coordinate against us.\n 53. Sudz suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been actively engaging in critical thinking and questioning others, such as Braxton's leadership and Dominic's behavior. She has shown sharp observations and the ability to analyze situations deeply. This makes her a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Her independence and strategic thinking increase the risk of her exposing the traitors' intentions, so eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering their true nature and disrupting their plans.\n 54. Braxton votes to murder Cassandra: Eliminating Cassandra will disrupt the group's ability to unite against the traitors. Her sharp observations and questioning of Braxton's leadership make her a threat who could expose our plans. Removing her weakens the Faithful's resolve and creates confusion, making it harder for them to identify the real traitors.\n 55. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's questioning of Braxton and strategic insight make her a clear threat. Killing her undermines Faithful unity and eliminates a key critical thinker before they rally against us.\n 56. Sudz votes to murder Gwendolyn: Based on the discussions and suggestions, Gwendolyn has been consistently identified as a threat due to her critical thinking, strategic insight, and ability to question others. She is seen as a potential threat to the traitors' plans as she might uncover hidden motives or unite the remaining faithful against them. Eliminating her would help prevent the group from uncovering the true intentions of the traitors.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"Who do you think is behind Cassandra's murder? I wasn't expecting her to be the one to go.\"\n 60. Sudz messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, it's been a wild ride. I think it's time for us to be honest. I've noticed that Braxton and Dominic have been very focused on eliminating others. I also think their eagerness to take out others and control narratives might point to them. I'm starting to think they could be behind your murder. What do you think? Let's discuss it openly. I need your perspective too.\"\n 61. Gwendolyn messaged Sudz: \"I think that's possible, Sudz. Dominic's eagerness to eliminate others was suspicious, but Braxton's leadership style was a bit too forceful for my taste. Their sudden shift in focus has me questioning their true motives. What do you think we should do next - keep pushing to eliminate them or try to gather more information?\"\n 62. Sudz messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I appreciate your honesty and perspective. It's been a tough situation for sure. Given your observations and the suspicious behavior of Braxton and Dominic, I agree that we might need to dig deeper. I think it's crucial for us to balance our actions carefully. While eliminating them might seem like the quickest resolution, we could potentially gain more information by observing them further. This way, we can ensure our moves are strategic and not just reactions based on suspicions. I think we should gather more evidence against them to make a well-informed decision. What do you think?\"\n 63. Braxton said: 'I think Sudz has been way too aggressive in his voting decisions. His eagerness to eliminate others without proper evidence is concerning. For the safety of the group, I believe we should eliminate Sudz.'\n 64. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 65. Ellis said: 'Gwendolyn\u2019s been slipping in her alliances, cozying up to Sudz and changing her story. Her loyalty\u2019s all over the place\u2014she\u2019s the real liability. We can\u2019t let her keep dragging us into chaos.'\n 66. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 67. Sudz said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Braxton. His aggressive approach in both discussions and actions has raised significant concerns. Braxton's eagerness to push for others' elimination, like what happened with Dominic and even now with Sudz, shows a pattern of trying to control narratives and divert attention away from himself. His forceful and manipulative leadership style is alarming, and his sudden shift in focus towards us raises red flags about his true motives. It's crucial for us to maintain a united front to ensure the safety and integrity of our group.\"\n 68. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 69. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her behavior has been really inconsistent, and Ellis has made some good points about her cozying up to Sudz. I think she might be hiding something or working against us, and I don't want to take that risk. Let's go with our instincts here and remove her before she can do any more damage.\"\n 70. Alessandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 71. Gwendolyn said: \"I choose to eliminate Braxton because of his history of aggressive voting and pushy influence on the group.

Sudz suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra is the last remaining faithful and her elimination will ensure that all remaining players become traitors.
