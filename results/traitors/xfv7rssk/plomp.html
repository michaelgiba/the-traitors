Ellis messaged Beef: 'Hey Beef, we gotta trust each other here. Let\u2019s work together to root out the real traitors. What do you think about teaming up?'\n 4. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I'm down to team up and figure out who's behind this. I'm thinking Alessandra or Braxton might be suspicious. What are your thoughts?\"\n 5. Beef messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I'm teaming up with Ellis. We're thinking Alessandra or Braxton might be traitors. Your thoughts?\"\n 6. Sudz messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, I agree with you. I'm leaning towards Alessandra as a traitor too.\"\n 7. Alessandra said: \"I think Braxton has been acting really off. I don't trust him and believe he might be a traitor. Let's vote him out.\"\n 8.

Let's make sure we're safe by removing them.\"\n 12. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 13. Cassandra said: \"I'm going with Braxton. While I understand his reasoning for suggesting Beef, it feels like a bit of a deflection tactic. His behavior has been inconsistent all game, and I don't trust him.\"\n 14. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 15. Ellis said: 'We\u2019ve gotta go with what most of us agree on. Braxton\u2019s actions are raising red flags\u2014see how fast he flipped to voting Beef? Let\u2019s cut the noise and get rid of the real problem here. I\u2019m voting Braxton out.'\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 17.

Braxton was BANISHED with 5 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 22. Sudz was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 23. Beef messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, I'm still shaken by Sudz getting murdered. We need to be careful. I'm thinking Dominic might be a traitor since Sudz voted him out before getting murdered.\"\n 24. Alessandra messaged Beef: \"Yeah, I've been feeling the same way about Dominic. His behavior has been really off, especially after Sudz voted him out. Maybe Sudz was onto something.\"\n 25. Alessandra messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, I totally get why you're suspicious of Dominic, but I think he's just been really cautious. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. Maybe we should keep an eye on Cassandra or Ellis\u2014they've been acting a bit off too. Let's gather more info before making any moves.\"\n 26. Beef messaged Alessandra: \"Alright, I'm keeping an eye on everyone. But we need to be careful, if Sudz was right about Dominic, they're not gonna be happy we didn't eliminate them. We should watch Ellis too, they were pretty quick to vote Braxton out.\"\n 27. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting Ellis because their aggressive behavior is causing too much division. It feels like they might be a traitor trying to stir the pot. Let's remove the chaos.\"\n 28. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 29. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Ellis. Their aggressive behavior is causing division and they seem to be stirring the pot. I think they're a threat to our group and need to go.\"\n 30. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 31. Cassandra said: \"I'm going with Alessandra. While I understand the concern about Ellis's behavior, Alessandra seems to be the most driven by creating chaos and pushing agendas.  Her vote for Ellis feels like a way to control the narrative and keep us focused on someone else. I believe she's playing a manipulative game and needs to go.\"\n 32. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 33. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s sudden about-face from targeting Braxton to betraying this group by voting me out is classic Traitor play.

Beef said: \"I'm voting out Alessandra. She's been flip-flopping on her votes and creating chaos. First, she voted Braxton out, then she voted Ellis out. It's like she's trying to distract us from the real traitors. We can't trust her.\"\n 36. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 37. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS a traitor\n 38. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 39. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 40. Dominic votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. With only three players left, including me and the other traitor, if we all agree to end it, we traitors win and split the $500,000. If we don't end it and someone gets eliminated, there's a chance the faithful could win everything. I'm playing it safe and securing my share of the prize.\n 41. Cassandra votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While I know Dominic is a traitor, I'm not confident we can unanimously vote him out.  Ending the game now guarantees the traitors win. I'll try to get Dominic eliminated in the next round and secure the prize for the faithful.\n 42. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Dominic is a traitor or not, but if we end the game and he's a traitor, we'll get nothing. We need to try to eliminate the traitor before ending the game.\n 43. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 44.
