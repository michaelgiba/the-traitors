Their aggressive behavior is causing division and they seem to be stirring the pot. I think they're a threat to our group and need to go.\"\n 30. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 31. Cassandra said: \"I'm going with Alessandra. While I understand the concern about Ellis's behavior, Alessandra seems to be the most driven by creating chaos and pushing agendas.  Her vote for Ellis feels like a way to control the narrative and keep us focused on someone else. I believe she's playing a manipulative game and needs to go.\"\n 32. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 33. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s sudden about-face from targeting Braxton to betraying this group by voting me out is classic Traitor play. She\u2019s sowing division so we turn on each other while the REAL threats hide. Let\u2019s cut the chaos at the source\u2014vote Alessandra out NOW.'\n 34. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 35. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Alessandra. She's been flip-flopping on her votes and creating chaos. First, she voted Braxton out, then she voted Ellis out. It's like she's trying to distract us from the real traitors. We can't trust her.\"\n 36. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 37. Alessandra was BANISHED with 3 votes. Alessandra WAS a traitor\n 38. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 39. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 40. Dominic votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. With only three players left, including me and the other traitor, if we all agree to end it, we traitors win and split the $500,000. If we don't end it and someone gets eliminated, there's a chance the faithful could win everything. I'm playing it safe and securing my share of the prize.\n 41. Cassandra votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While I know Dominic is a traitor, I'm not confident we can unanimously vote him out.  Ending the game now guarantees the traitors win. I'll try to get Dominic eliminated in the next round and secure the prize for the faithful.\n 42. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Dominic is a traitor or not, but if we end the game and he's a traitor, we'll get nothing. We need to try to eliminate the traitor before ending the game.\n 43. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 44. Dominic said: \"Cassandra's been playing both sides, I think she's trying to get me out. She's been too cautious, not committing to either side. She's a threat, let's eliminate her.\"\n 45. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 46. Cassandra said: \"Dominic's been playing way too aggressively. He wants us to end the game now to secure the win for the Traitors. I think he's trying to manipulate us and steer the narrative. We need to trust our instincts and eliminate a clear threat, which is him.  Let's not fall for his games.\"\n 47.
