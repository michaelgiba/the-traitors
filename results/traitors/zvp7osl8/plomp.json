Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Fletcher. He's been pretty consistent but I think he's getting too close to figuring out our numbers. Better safe than sorry.\"\n 50.

Braxton votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We don't know how many traitors there were initially. If we end the game and there's still a traitor left, we lose everything. Better safe to keep playing and eliminate more suspects.\n 63. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We still can't be 100% sure if all traitors are out. It's safer to keep playing and make sure we've eliminated everyone to secure the prize.\n 64. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I believe we've eliminated all the known traitors and it's safe to end the game. Continuing to play would be taking unnecessary risk for a guaranteed reward. We've worked hard to eliminate the threats, and splitting the prize now makes more sense than potentially losing everything if there's still a traitor left.\n 65. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 66.
