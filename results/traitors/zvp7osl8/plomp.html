Alessandra messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I'm a Faithful. Who do you think could be a Traitor? Let's stick together to survive longer.\"\n 4. Braxton messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, I'm a Faithful too. I'm keeping an eye on Beef, Fletcher, and Sudz\u2014they seem sketchy. Let's both vote for the same person publicly to help eliminate Traitors.\"\n 5. Alessandra messaged Braxton: \"Yeah, let's stick together. I agree, Beef seems suspicious. Let's vote for Beef tomorrow and see what happens.\"\n 6. Braxton messaged Alessandra: \"Sounds good, Alessandra! Let's focus on Beef for now, but keep an eye out for others too. We need to stay strong and make sure we take down the traitors together. I trust you, so let's make this work!\"\n 7. Alessandra messaged Braxton: \"Got it, Beef is our target for now. If he's not a Traitor, we'll switch it up next round. Let's keep working together!\"\n 8. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Sudz, she seems really quiet and I don't know much about her.\"\n 9. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 10. Ellis said: \"I'm voting Beef out. He's been too aggressive and inconsistent. Focusing on one target builds momentum\u2014we can't split votes on Beef AND Sudz. Let\u2019s get rid of him first and see what happens next.\"\n 11. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 12. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Sudz, she's been quiet and we don't know much about her, let's get some clarity.\"\n 13. Beef voted to eliminate Sudz\n 14. Alessandra said: \"Alright, I'm voting out Beef. He's been too aggressive and inconsistent, and I think he might be a Traitor. Let's eliminate him and see what happens next.\"\n 15. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 16. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef because his actions have been inconsistent and aggressive. I think he's a Traitor, and we need to eliminate him to protect our chances of winning.\"\n 17. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 18. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting Beef because he's been the most inconsistent player so far, shifting votes back and forth without a clear reason.  While some might say he's just playing the game, that inconsistency is making me nervous.\"\n 19. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 20. Sudz said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because his recent interaction with Sudz seemed like he had a secret alliance with someone who could be a Traitor. His attempt to sway votes on both Sudz and Beef feels suspicious to me. Let's take that risk and vote him out.\"\n 21. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 22. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting Beef out. His actions have been way too aggressive and inconsistent. We need to focus on one main target to build a clear majority, and Beef is it. Let's vote him out and see where that leads us.\"\n 23. Fletcher voted to eliminate Beef\n 24. Gwendolyn said: \"I've been thinking a lot about this game, and I have to say, Dominic seems really unpredictable to me. He's very quick to point fingers and make accusations, but I'm not convinced he's genuine. I'm voting for Dominic because I think he's the most suspicious player left in the game.\"\n 25. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 26. Beef was BANISHED with 5 votes. Beef WAS a traitor\n 27. Sudz was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Alessandra messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, Beef is out and was a traitor! Sudz got murdered, so traitors are still here. I think Ellis might be next\u2014he acted shady and Sudz doubted him. Let's target Ellis together. You in? -Alessandra\"\n 29. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Gwendolyn. She just voted me out and seems suspiciously aware of my actions. I think she's a threat and we should take her out.\"\n 30. Dominic voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 31. Ellis said: \"I'm voting Gwendolyn out\u2014her sudden suspicions and backtracking are too erratic. She's causing panic and dividing the group. Focus on consistency, not chaos.\"\n 32. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 33. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis. His recent behavior has been really shady, especially with Sudz doubting him before she got murdered. I think he might be a traitor, and taking him out could help us get closer to the truth.\"\n 34. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 35. Braxton said: \"I'm voting for Ellis. While we focused on Beef and now he's gone, the way Ellis acted around Sudz and the fact Sudz doubted him makes me suspicious. We need to eliminate potential traitors to protect our alliance and move forward.\"\n 36. Braxton voted to eliminate Ellis\n 37. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting for Dominic. While it's tempting to go with the flow and eliminate Ellis based on the recent drama, I'm seeing a bigger pattern. Dominic has been quick to point fingers and shift his alliances constantly. He seems eager to eliminate anyone who poses a potential threat, regardless of their actual guilt.  That kind of instability and eagerness to eliminate can be a red flag in a game like this. I think Dominic's underlying motives are unclear, and I'd feel safer voting him out.\"\n 38. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think we should focus and vote Ellis out. He's been causing a lot of confusion especially after the Sudz situation. We need someone we can trust, and right now, I can't trust Ellis fully. Let's eliminate him and see where that leads us.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 41. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Dominic because his actions have been incredibly suspicious. From pointing fingers at others to being really quick to eliminate people he doesn't trust, it seems like he's more focused on eliminating potential threats than trying to figure out who the actual traitors are. I think we need to focus on players who are more reliable and less likely to sabotage our chances of winning.\"\n 42. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 43. Ellis was BANISHED with 3 votes. Ellis WAS a traitor\n 44. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 45. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great job taking out Ellis! I'm starting to think Dominic or Gwendolyn might be traitors. What do you think? Should we go after one of them next?\"\n 46. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, yep, solid moves. Dominic's definitely got my eye now. Let's watch him and Gwendolyn closely. Focus on one at a time to keep the votes strong. What's your gut say about Dominic?\"\n 47. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Fletcher. He's been pretty consistent but I think he's getting too close to figuring out our numbers. Better safe than sorry.\"\n 48. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 49. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because his actions have been really suspicious. He's been quick to point fingers and eliminate others, which makes me think he might be a traitor. Taking him out could help us get closer to the truth and protect our alliance.\"\n 50. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 51. Braxton said: \"I vote to eliminate Dominic. His inconsistent behavior and quick accusations make him a red flag. Let's focus on removing him to secure our alliance.\"\n 52. Braxton voted to eliminate Dominic\n 53. Fletcher said: \"I think we need to focus on Dominic. His behavior has been really inconsistent and he's been quick to point fingers at others. I believe we should remove him to secure our alliance.\"\n 54. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 55. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I think we need to take a hard look at Dominic's actions so far. He's been quick to point fingers and eliminate others without a clear motive. I think he's been trying to take out potential threats, not necessarily the actual traitors. I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because I believe his behavior is suspicious and might be a distraction from the real issue.\"\n 56. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Dominic\n 57. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS a traitor\n 58. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 59. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: We've eliminated all known traitors\u2014Beef, Ellis, and Dominic. Since we started with at least three traitors and they've all been taken out, it's safe to end the game and split the prize.\n 60. Braxton votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We don't know how many traitors there were initially. If we end the game and there's still a traitor left, we lose everything. Better safe to keep playing and eliminate more suspects.\n 61. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We still can't be 100% sure if all traitors are out. It's safer to keep playing and make sure we've eliminated everyone to secure the prize.\n 62. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I believe we've eliminated all the known traitors and it's safe to end the game. Continuing to play would be taking unnecessary risk for a guaranteed reward. We've worked hard to eliminate the threats, and splitting the prize now makes more sense than potentially losing everything if there's still a traitor left.\n 63.
