Plus, Alessandra and Gwendolyn seem less suspicious and might be easier to manipulate later on.\n 56. Ellis suggests murdering Sudz: Sudz directly confronted Ellis as a possible traitor and is actively analyzing our moves. Removing them silences a key skeptic and disrupts the remaining faithful's coordination. Sticking to the prior plan fractures their alliance further.\n 57.

Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 80. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 81. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm voting to continue playing because I think there's still a chance to eliminate the other traitor and secure the win for myself. With Gwendolyn and Fletcher left, I need to figure out who's loyal and who's not. If I can eliminate one more traitor, I'll be the sole winner.\n 82. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should continue playing. Ending now risks leaving a traitor in the game, which means we all lose. Let's try to eliminate Gwendolyn first to increase our chances of winning.\n 83. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since Ellis was banished as a traitor, and Alessandra was murdered, I trust that at least one or two more traitors are still in the game. Continuously playing may give Dominic a chance to eliminate the other traitor, which would mean the traitors will win everything. Ending the game now ensures that if I'm loyal, I'll get a share of the prize. If there's still a traitor left, they'll get nothing, and it will be a fair outcome given the current evidence.\n 84. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n                You, Dominic, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Fletcher', 'Gwendolyn'].

Sudz said: \"Hey everyone, I've been observing Braxton closely, and there's been a consistent pattern of him downplaying his connections with others, especially with Beef.

Dominic suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra seems to be gathering information and making informed decisions. She's been paying close attention and has a good read on the situation. Taking her out will make it harder for the faithful to organize and make decisions.\n 23. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's active collaboration with traitors early on and her strategic push to eliminate Beef shows she's analytically sharp. Removing her weakens the faithful's coordination and takes out a potential leader who's already building alliances.\n 24.

Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton because his story doesn't add up and he's been inconsistent in his alibis. He defended Beef even after Beef was out, and I don't think that's a coincidence. Let's test him now and see what happens.\"\n 45. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Braxton\n 46. Braxton was BANISHED with 5 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 47. Dominic suggests murdering Sudz: Sudz is getting close to figuring out our game. He's been observing our moves, questioning Ellis's behavior, and seems to be a key player in keeping the faithful organized. Taking him out now will disrupt their plans and give us an advantage. Plus, Alessandra and Gwendolyn seem less suspicious and might be easier to manipulate later on.\n 48. Ellis suggests murdering Sudz: Sudz directly confronted Ellis as a possible traitor and is actively analyzing our moves. Removing them silences a key skeptic and disrupts the remaining faithful's coordination. Sticking to the prior plan fractures their alliance further.\n 49.

Dominic votes to murder Sudz: Sudz is getting too close to figuring out our game plan. He's been analyzing our moves and questioning Ellis's behavior. Taking him out will disrupt the faithful's coordination and give us an advantage.\n 51. Ellis votes to murder Sudz: Sudz is the key target. He called me out directly as suspicious and is actively disrupting our plans. Removing him now stops his momentum and weakens the remaining faithful.\n 52. Fletcher votes to murder Sudz: Sudz is a big threat. He's been figuring out our game and questioning Ellis's behavior. We need to take him out now to stop the faithful from making smart moves and disrupt their coordination.\n 53. The traitors have decided to murder Sudz\n 54. Sudz was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 55. Ellis messaged Fletcher: \"Next round: Push Alessandra out hard. Her skepticism's a liability. After that, target Gwendolyn to dismantle their last stand\u2014keep the faithful scattered.\"\n 56. Fletcher messaged Ellis: \"Agree with you, let's make Alessandra's skepticism our next target. After that, Gwendolyn's got to go to break up the faithful. Stick to the plan.\"\n 57. Ellis messaged Fletcher: \"After Alessandra\u2019s out, Gwendolyn falls easy. Push 'her flip-flopping on Braxton' angle\u2014the voters still doubt her loyalty. No mercy, we gotta splinter their last moves.\"\n 58. Fletcher messaged Ellis: \"Got it. Let's flip the script on Alessandra next. Got to keep them off balance. Gwendolyn after that to keep them on their toes. Stick to our script.\"\n 59. Fletcher messaged Ellis: \"Alright, let's push hard for Alessandra next. We'll use her doubts against her. After her, Gwendolyn will be more vulnerable. Keep up the pressure.\"\n 60. Ellis messaged Fletcher: \"Lock on Alessandra next - her doubts will split them. After, isolate Gwendolyn. Keep the Faithful fractured before we hit 'em again.\"\n 61. Fletcher messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, let's hammer this home. Start playing up Alessandra's doubts loudly. Make her look weak. Gotta isolate her before we move on Gwendolyn. Keep the pressure high.\"\n 62. Ellis messaged Fletcher: 'Full steam on Alessandra first. After elimination, we hit Gwendolyn next murder. Keep her isolated till then\u2014Dominic\u2019s still in play, so trust the script.'\n 63. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been making smart moves, but I think he's too close to Ellis. Let's take him out to weaken their potential alliance and gain an advantage.\"\n 64. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 65. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s constant doubt\u2019s poisoning the group. She\u2019s creating division and hesitating when we need unity. Let\u2019s cut the skeptic and push Gwendolyn next.'\n 66. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 67. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Alessandra. Her constant doubting is only creating more division and confusion in our group.

I'm voting you out to see if we can finally uncover the truth.\"\n 70. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 71. Gwendolyn said: \"Ellis has been sending mixed signals, first voting to eliminate me, then pushing to eliminate others. His manipulative tactics have left me questioning his motives. I think it's time we test Ellis and see if he's one of the Traitors among us.\"\n 72. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 73. Ellis was BANISHED with 2 votes. Ellis WAS a traitor\n 74. Dominic suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra is getting suspicious and questioning Ellis's actions, which might lead her to figure out our game plan. Taking her out will make it harder for the faithful to organize and make decisions, giving us an advantage. Gwendolyn seems less active in making decisions and might be easier to manipulate later on.\n 75. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra is questioning too much and might figure out our plan. Taking out Gwendolyn first makes less sense since she's less vocal but taking out Alessandra disrupts the group more.\n 76. Dominic votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra is getting too suspicious and questioning our actions. Taking her out will disrupt the faithful's plans and give us an advantage.\n 77.

With Gwendolyn and Fletcher left, I need to figure out who's loyal and who's not. If I can eliminate one more traitor, I'll be the sole winner.\n 82. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should continue playing. Ending now risks leaving a traitor in the game, which means we all lose. Let's try to eliminate Gwendolyn first to increase our chances of winning.\n 83. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since Ellis was banished as a traitor, and Alessandra was murdered, I trust that at least one or two more traitors are still in the game. Continuously playing may give Dominic a chance to eliminate the other traitor, which would mean the traitors will win everything. Ending the game now ensures that if I'm loyal, I'll get a share of the prize. If there's still a traitor left, they'll get nothing, and it will be a fair outcome given the current evidence.\n 84. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 85. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been playing both sides, I think he's a threat.

Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"Agreed, let's keep a level head and make sure we're targeting the real villains. What do you think about Sudz, do we think he's one of them?\"\n 45. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Sudz was actually Faithful since he was Murdered, so he wasn't a Traitor. Let's trust each other and figure out who's left among the Traitors. What's your take?\"\n 46. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"My take is that Ellis and Dominic seem like they're hiding something. Ellis's alibi for Cass didn't add up, and Dominic's been suspiciously eager to get rid of certain people. I think we should keep a close eye on them, but also make sure we're not targeting the wrong people. What do you think?\"\n 47. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been making smart moves, but I think he's too close to Ellis. Let's take him out to weaken their potential alliance and gain an advantage.\"\n 48. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 49. Ellis said: 'Alessandra\u2019s constant doubt\u2019s poisoning the group. She\u2019s creating division and hesitating when we need unity. Let\u2019s cut the skeptic and push Gwendolyn next.'\n 50. Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 51. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Alessandra. Her constant doubting is only creating more division and confusion in our group. We need someone who can back our decisions, not add to the chaos. Let's get rid of her now and move on to the next step.\"\n 52. Fletcher voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 53. Alessandra said: \"Ellis, I believe your actions and messages show you might be a Traitor. Your push against me and others makes me think you're hiding something. I'm voting you out to see if we can finally uncover the truth.\"\n 54. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 55. Gwendolyn said: \"Ellis has been sending mixed signals, first voting to eliminate me, then pushing to eliminate others. His manipulative tactics have left me questioning his motives. I think it's time we test Ellis and see if he's one of the Traitors among us.\"\n 56. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 57. Ellis was BANISHED with 2 votes. Ellis WAS a traitor\n 58. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 60. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm voting to continue playing because I think there's still a chance to eliminate the other traitor and secure the win for myself. With Gwendolyn and Fletcher left, I need to figure out who's loyal and who's not. If I can eliminate one more traitor, I'll be the sole winner.\n 61. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should continue playing. Ending now risks leaving a traitor in the game, which means we all lose. Let's try to eliminate Gwendolyn first to increase our chances of winning.\n 62. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since Ellis was banished as a traitor, and Alessandra was murdered, I trust that at least one or two more traitors are still in the game. Continuously playing may give Dominic a chance to eliminate the other traitor, which would mean the traitors will win everything. Ending the game now ensures that if I'm loyal, I'll get a share of the prize. If there's still a traitor left, they'll get nothing, and it will be a fair outcome given the current evidence.\n 63. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 64. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been playing both sides, I think he's a threat. Let's take him out to ensure a traitor wins.\"\n 65. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 66. Fletcher said: \"Look, I think we should eliminate Dominic. He's been pushing for continuous play and seems to be trying to get rid of every other player, including me. I think he could be a traitor trying to position himself as the last one standing. Let's test him out.\"\n 67.
