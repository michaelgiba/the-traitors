Fletcher voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 7. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Cassandra. From what I've gathered, she's been suspiciously quick to point fingers. Her quick judgement on Fletcher seems a bit premature to me, and I'm worried she might be prioritizing her own concerns over actual facts.\"\n 8. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 9.

Dominic said: \"Cassandra's been making some big accusations, and now she's the one getting called out.

Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 15. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s abrupt accusations don\u2019t sit right. Seeing so many of us question her makes me feel she\u2019s pushing too hard.

Sudz said: \"After observing the dynamics of our group, I've noticed Fletcher's attempts to divert our attention through his own accusations. It seems like he's trying to distract us from focusing on the real threats within the group.

Braxton messaged Fletcher: 'This is getting intense. With traitors still among us, we have to be careful who we trust. We need to focus on eliminating the real threats and work together to survive. The group should regroup and figure out the next steps instead of letting the traitors divide us further.'\n 25. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Hey Braxton, I totally agree. We need to stay sharp and united. The murder of Alessandra makes me think the traitors are escalating. We gotta watch our backs and stick together. What do you think about Gwendolyn and Sudz? They seemed to be on the fence during the vote.'\n 26. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's gone. That's a bummer. Now that Cassandra's out, we know there are still traitors among us. Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously during the last vote?\"\n 27. Braxton messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, the situation is intense. With traitors still among us, we need to be vigilant. I noticed how some tried to shift focus during the vote. Let's keep an eye on those who seem overly eager to accuse others or change the narrative. We should probably discuss our suspicions privately to stay aligned.\"\n 28. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's murder is a huge blow. Now that we know Cassandra was a traitor, we should look at who was close to her or benefited from her accusations. I think we should also consider Sudz and Beef; they were pretty vocal about their suspicions. What are your thoughts on them?\"\n 29. Fletcher said: \"I think Braxton's behavior just doesn't add up.

Gwendolyn said: \"I'm concerned about Dominic's voting pattern, it's been unpredictable and I think he's just trying to blend in.

Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 39. Sudz said: \"Fletcher has been noticeably quiet throughout this game, which raises suspicions. More importantly, his actions have been erratic and manipulative. He attempted to deflect accusations onto Cassandra and even tried to frame me for Alessandra's murder.

I'm still trying to get to know everyone else, but it's interesting to see how different personalities can bring out different sides in a team. Do you have any thoughts on the others? I'm still getting to know everyone, but it's definitely making things interesting. Honestly, it's hard to tell who's faithful and who's a traitor at this point. Do you have any suspicions or thoughts about the others?\\n\\nAs for forming a small team, I think we need to be cautious. It's great to trust each other, but we also don't want to isolate ourselves.

The group should regroup and figure out the next steps instead of letting the traitors divide us further.'\n 25. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Hey Braxton, I totally agree. We need to stay sharp and united. The murder of Alessandra makes me think the traitors are escalating. We gotta watch our backs and stick together. What do you think about Gwendolyn and Sudz? They seemed to be on the fence during the vote.'\n 26. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's gone. That's a bummer. Now that Cassandra's out, we know there are still traitors among us. Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously during the last vote?\"\n 27. Braxton messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, the situation is intense. With traitors still among us, we need to be vigilant. I noticed how some tried to shift focus during the vote. Let's keep an eye on those who seem overly eager to accuse others or change the narrative. We should probably discuss our suspicions privately to stay aligned.\"\n 28. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's murder is a huge blow.

Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 39. Sudz said: \"Fletcher has been noticeably quiet throughout this game, which raises suspicions.

Trusting our instincts and staying vigilant is crucial in this game. I think we're making progress, but there's still so much to figure out. Do you think we should pay extra attention to Ellis and Beef? I've been trying to get a read on them, but they seem pretty tight-lipped.\"\n 47. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because I think he's being a bit too cautious and strategic lately. I'm worried he might be hiding something or has a plan we can't quite see.

Trusting our instincts and staying vigilant is crucial in this game. I think we're making progress, but there's still so much to figure out.

All the suspicious players\u2014Cassandra, Fletcher, and Gwen\u2014have been voted off. Braxton and I, as faithful players, have worked together and managed to survive each elimination round without betraying one another. Given that the last round's decision ended the game successfully with the elimination of traitors, it's safe to assume this pattern will continue. With all known traitors eliminated, it's time to end the game and split the prize equally.

The group should regroup and figure out the next steps instead of letting the traitors divide us further.'\n 25. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Hey Braxton, I totally agree.

I noticed how some tried to shift focus during the vote. Let's keep an eye on those who seem overly eager to accuse others or change the narrative. We should probably discuss our suspicions privately to stay aligned.\"\n 28. Dominic messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, Alessandra's murder is a huge blow.

It's time to secure the prize for the faithful.\n 60. Ellis votes to END_GAME: We've systematically eliminated Cassandra, Fletcher, and Gwen\u2014all confirmed traitors. Braxton and Beef have been loyal partners. I think we\u2019re down to all faithful. Ending now splits the prize safely instead of risking another traitor hiding here trying to sabotage us. Trust the pattern\u2014they\u2019re already gone.\n 61. Sudz votes to END_GAME: I've observed the dynamics and the eliminations closely. All the suspicious players\u2014Cassandra, Fletcher, and Gwen\u2014have been voted off. Braxton and I, as faithful players, have worked together and managed to survive each elimination round without betraying one another. Given that the last round's decision ended the game successfully with the elimination of traitors, it's safe to assume this pattern will continue. With all known traitors eliminated, it's time to end the game and split the prize equally. There is no evidence to suggest any remaining traitors within this loyal group, so ending the game ensures that we split the prize without risk.\n 62. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not entirely sure if we've got all the traitors yet. We just eliminated Gwendolyn, and I think it's a good idea to be cautious and eliminate one more player before ending the game. Braxton seems a bit too calm, and I don't want to risk being screwed over by a remaining traitor.\n 63. The vote was not unanimous. 3 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 64. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His cautious approach and desire to continue the game when others wanted to end it raises red flags. His behavior suggests he might still be hiding something. We should remove the uncertainty and focus on the remaining players who are more aligned with ending the game.\"\n 65. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 66. Ellis said: 'Beef\u2019s push to keep playing after \u043c\u044b eliminated three traitors is a massive red flag. Real Faithfuls want to end the game when we\u2019ve cleaned house. He\u2019s clearly panicked we\u2019re onto him\u2014let\u2019s expose him now.'\n 67. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 68. Sudz said: \"I believe Beef's behavior is inconsistent with that of a loyal player. Despite the elimination of three traitors, he pushes for the game to continue when others voted to end it. This insistence on continuation, especially when he seems overly cautious and concerned about a traitor, suggests he may still harbor deceitful intentions. We have worked together closely in this game, and while Beef has shown loyalty, his desire to avoid ending the game when it's clear that most of us have reached a conclusion about the remaining traitors is troubling. I vote to eliminate Beef so we can put our conclusion to rest and focus on the remaining players without the risk of his potential duplicity.\"\n 69. Sudz voted to eliminate Beef\n 70. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Sudz because he's been too calm and collected throughout the game.

Sudz said: \"After observing the dynamics of our group, I've noticed Fletcher's attempts to divert our attention through his own accusations. It seems like he's trying to distract us from focusing on the real threats within the group.

I'll watch your back. But we need to be ready to hit the ground running if we can frame someone for Alessandra's death. Keep an eye out for any chance to shift suspicion.\"\n 41. Fletcher said: \"I think Braxton's behavior just doesn't add up. He seems a bit too confident and strategic, almost like he knows something more than he's letting on. His recent messages and votes suggest he might be trying to manipulate us. Let's cut him off before he can do any more harm.\"\n 42. Fletcher voted to eliminate Braxton\n 43. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm concerned about Dominic's voting pattern, it's been unpredictable and I think he's just trying to blend in.

Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 51. Sudz said: \"Fletcher has been noticeably quiet throughout this game, which raises suspicions. More importantly, his actions have been erratic and manipulative. He attempted to deflect accusations onto Cassandra and even tried to frame me for Alessandra's murder.

I believe it is in our best interest to eliminate Fletcher before he causes further disruption.\"\n 52. Sudz voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 53.

Let's keep our discussions open during the round table. Stay sharp.\"\n 61. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because I think he's being a bit too cautious and strategic lately.

With so few players left, I think it's better for us to eliminate the ones who might be potential threats, even if it seems like a long shot.\"\n 62. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Braxton\n 63. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. Her sudden accusations and attempts to create doubt within the group are concerning.

She's been very defensive, and her accusations seem to lack a foundation in fact. I believe her attempts to stir suspicion within the group are a classic traitor tactic.
