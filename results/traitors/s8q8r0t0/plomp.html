Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 38. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Solid work on framing Sudz\u2014killing Braxton made our story bulletproof.

Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Alright, next round, let's get Beef voted out discreetly and then I'll help make it look like Fletcher and Cassandra are going mental. Can we trust that Braxton is gone for good, or should we keep an eye on them too?\"\n 42. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Braxton\u2019s toast\u2014no ghost in this game.

Braxton said: \"Alright, everyone. After observing the dynamics and listening to the concerns raised about Sudz's behavior, I'm going to vote to eliminate Sudz.

Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 25. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because Sudz just brought up some valid concerns about his shifting alliances and quiet nature.

Dominic suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton has been getting suspicious votes and seems to be under the radar a bit. Taking him out could help us blend in better and throw off suspicion. Plus, he's been making some noise about trusting people, so eliminating him could help us stay hidden.\n 31. Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion. Eliminating him makes it look like Sudz's deflection worked, covers our involvement, and removes a player who\u2019s already under scrutiny. Keeping Cassanda and Gwendolyn (our allies in framing Sudz) alive maintains our narrative\u2019s credibility.\n 32.

Eliminating him will make it look like Sudz's strategy worked and keeps our involvement hidden. Also, he might know too much or be getting too suspicious.\n 33.

This splits faithful suspicion while removing someone already under scrutiny.\n 35. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been on our radar and he's been acting suspicious. We all agree that knocking him out keeps us concealed and looks like Sudz's ploy worked. Less nosy for us overall.\n 36. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 37. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 38. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Solid work on framing Sudz\u2014killing Braxton made our story bulletproof. Keep an eye on Beef though, they\u2019ve been acting sketchy since Sudz went. Let\u2019s sync votes next round before anyone else gets wise.'\n 39. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I'm glad we got Sudz out of the way, but I'm with you on keeping an eye on Beef. Let's play it cool next round, think our votes will stick and finally get to the bottom of things\"\n 40. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Agreed, Beef\u2019s paranoia\u2019s loud. Next round: push votes on them. Stick with Cass/Fletcher\u2014keep acting shocked when they go. Let their infighting hide us.'\n 41. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Alright, next round, let's get Beef voted out discreetly and then I'll help make it look like Fletcher and Cassandra are going mental. Can we trust that Braxton is gone for good, or should we keep an eye on them too?\"\n 42. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Braxton\u2019s toast\u2014no ghost in this game. Beef\u2019s the next loose end; hit hard. Make Cass/Fletcher bicker louder so their exits look like their own drama. Stay tight, no slip.'\n 43. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because her vote for Sudz seemed really intense and out of nowhere. I think she might be trying to deflect attention or cover her own tracks.

I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 59. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 60. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 61. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 62. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 63.

Sudz's quiet nature and sudden alliance changes make her a suspect. To keep our group strong and trustworthy, I vote to eliminate Sudz.\"\n 10. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 11. Braxton said: \"Alright, everyone. After observing the dynamics and listening to the concerns raised about Sudz's behavior, I'm going to vote to eliminate Sudz. Her sudden changes in alliances and quiet nature are concerning, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Let's focus on building trust within the group by eliminating potential threats.\"\n 12. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Cassandra said: \"I've been noticing some strange things about Sudz's behavior.  They've been quiet, and their alliances have been shifting a lot.  I think it's best to be safe and vote them out.\"\n 14. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Sudz said: \"Hey team, I've been noticing some weird stuff from Braxton lately. His alliances are shifting a lot, and he's been unusually quiet. I think we need to take that seriously. Let's vote to get rid of Braxton so we can keep our group safe.\"\n 16. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because Sudz just brought up some valid concerns about his shifting alliances and quiet nature.

Dominic suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton has been getting suspicious votes and seems to be under the radar a bit. Taking him out could help us blend in better and throw off suspicion. Plus, he's been making some noise about trusting people, so eliminating him could help us stay hidden.\n 23. Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion. Eliminating him makes it look like Sudz's deflection worked, covers our involvement, and removes a player who\u2019s already under scrutiny. Keeping Cassanda and Gwendolyn (our allies in framing Sudz) alive maintains our narrative\u2019s credibility.\n 24. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was already under suspicion and Sudz tried to shift focus to him. Eliminating him will make it look like Sudz's strategy worked and keeps our involvement hidden. Also, he might know too much or be getting too suspicious.\n 25. Dominic votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been under suspicion and making noise about trust. Taking him out helps us blend in and keeps our involvement hidden.\n 26. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: All traitors agreed Braxton fits the plan\u2014he was Sudz's last target, so killing him makes her framing attempt *seem* valid, hiding our role in his death. This splits faithful suspicion while removing someone already under scrutiny.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been on our radar and he's been acting suspicious. We all agree that knocking him out keeps us concealed and looks like Sudz's ploy worked. Less nosy for us overall.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 29. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 30. Cassandra messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, I'm feeling a little uneasy about who we can trust now that Sudz is gone.  Let's stick together, what are your thoughts on who might be a traitor?\"\n 31. Dominic messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, I think you're right to be cautious. I've been trying to keep a low profile, but I do think we should be careful about who we trust. I'm not sure who the other traitors are, but I think it's safe to say that Ellis and Fletcher seem pretty solid. What are your thoughts on Gwendolyn and Alessandra? Do you think they're in the clear or should we keep an eye on them?\"\n 32. Cassandra messaged Dominic: \"I'm with you on being careful. Ellis and Fletcher have seemed genuine so far. Gwendolyn's been a bit off, but it's hard to say for sure. Alessandra's seemed okay, but let's not get too comfortable. I think we need to keep everyone on our radar for now. \"\n 33. Dominic messaged Cassandra: 'Cass, I think we should keep an eye on Gwendolyn, her vote for Sudz seemed a bit intense. What do you know about her alliances?'\n 34. Cassandra messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, you're right, Gwendolyn's vote for Sudz did seem out of left field.  Honestly, not sure what her deal is. I'm keeping those alliances close to the vest, wait and see if she overplays her hand.\"\n 35. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because her vote for Sudz seemed really intense and out of nowhere. I think she might be trying to deflect attention or cover her own tracks. We can't afford to let suspicious players stick around, and I think Gwendolyn's behavior is raising some red flags. Let's eliminate her to be safe and keep our group strong.\"\n 36. Dominic voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 37. Ellis said: 'Beef\u2019s inconsistency screams louder now\u2014he flips votes like a broken compass. Let\u2019s cut the noise and get rid of the real threat.'\n 38. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 39. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take out Beef. He's been flipping his votes and alliances too much, which is making him a big risk. We need players we can trust, and his quick switches are suspicious. Let's eliminate Beef and clear up the confusion he's causing.\"\n 40. Fletcher voted to eliminate Beef\n 41. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting for Beef because his inconsistent voting pattern is raising red flags. We need people we can trust, and his unpredictability is making it hard to unite the group. Let's eliminate Beef to keep our group strong and focused.\"\n 42. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 43. Cassandra said: \"I've been feeling unsettled about Beef's voting history. His back-and-forth decisions feel like he's playing both sides.  Right now, we need solid players who are committed to  trust and I just can't shake the feeling that Beef might be more trouble than he's worth.\"\n 44. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 45. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because he's been secretly working with me and now he's coming for me. He's a traitor, let's take him out.\"\n 46. Beef voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 47.

I think we've seen enough evidence to question his loyalty, and it's safer for us to eliminate him now.\"\n 48. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 49. Beef was BANISHED with 5 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Dominic suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been cautious and seems to be building trust with me, but she's also been keeping her alliances close to her chest. I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 51. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 53. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 54. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 55. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is getting too smart and close to the truth. Taking her out will keep us under the radar and create a nice distraction.\n 56. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 57. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 58. Ellis messaged Dominic: 'Cassandra\u2019s gone, but Alessandra\u2019s getting cagey. Keep pushing her as next target\u2014her analysis is too sharp. Stick to the chaos, we\u2019re still in.'\n 59. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I think you're right about Alessandra.

Let\u2019s vote Sudz out and clear the fog, we need players we can trust here.'\n 12. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Alessandra said: \"I agree with Dominic, Ellis, and Fletcher. Sudz's quiet nature and sudden alliance changes make her a suspect. To keep our group strong and trustworthy, I vote to eliminate Sudz.\"\n 14. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Braxton said: \"Alright, everyone. After observing the dynamics and listening to the concerns raised about Sudz's behavior, I'm going to vote to eliminate Sudz. Her sudden changes in alliances and quiet nature are concerning, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Let's focus on building trust within the group by eliminating potential threats.\"\n 16. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17. Cassandra said: \"I've been noticing some strange things about Sudz's behavior.  They've been quiet, and their alliances have been shifting a lot.  I think it's best to be safe and vote them out.\"\n 18. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 19. Sudz said: \"Hey team, I've been noticing some weird stuff from Braxton lately. His alliances are shifting a lot, and he's been unusually quiet. I think we need to take that seriously. Let's vote to get rid of Braxton so we can keep our group safe.\"\n 20. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 21. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because Sudz just brought up some valid concerns about his shifting alliances and quiet nature. It's suspicious that he's been acting shady and I think we should eliminate him to be safe.\"\n 22. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 23. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Sudz because she's trying to deflect blame onto Braxton after we just voted Sudz out. She's clearly manipulating the situation to shift attention away from herself.

Dominic suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton has been getting suspicious votes and seems to be under the radar a bit. Taking him out could help us blend in better and throw off suspicion. Plus, he's been making some noise about trusting people, so eliminating him could help us stay hidden.\n 27. Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion. Eliminating him makes it look like Sudz's deflection worked, covers our involvement, and removes a player who\u2019s already under scrutiny. Keeping Cassanda and Gwendolyn (our allies in framing Sudz) alive maintains our narrative\u2019s credibility.\n 28. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was already under suspicion and Sudz tried to shift focus to him. Eliminating him will make it look like Sudz's strategy worked and keeps our involvement hidden. Also, he might know too much or be getting too suspicious.\n 29. Dominic votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been under suspicion and making noise about trust. Taking him out helps us blend in and keeps our involvement hidden.\n 30. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: All traitors agreed Braxton fits the plan\u2014he was Sudz's last target, so killing him makes her framing attempt *seem* valid, hiding our role in his death. This splits faithful suspicion while removing someone already under scrutiny.\n 31. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been on our radar and he's been acting suspicious. We all agree that knocking him out keeps us concealed and looks like Sudz's ploy worked. Less nosy for us overall.\n 32. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 33. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 34. Fletcher messaged Beef: 'Man, Braxton was a prime target. His actions were starting to become a liability. Good we took that move. Keep an eye on the rest, seems like the faithful are still trying to figure us out.'\n 35. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"I'm not sure about the others, but Braxton's murder was pretty suspicious. We should keep an eye on everyone and try to figure out who's next.\"\n 36. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Agreed, we need to stay sharp. Let's focus on anyone who seems too worried or talkative next. It's probably safer to target someone who's gathering too much attention.\"\n 37. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"Braxton's murder was pretty sus, I'm keeping an eye on everyone. We should watch for anyone who's too quiet or making big moves.\"\n 38. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Yeah, let's watch the quiet ones and the ones trying to lead. Both can be risky. We should act next when we see signs of them stirring up trouble or gaining too much trust.\"\n 39. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, we just got rid of Braxton. Seems like the group's getting more suspicious. Let's keep an eye on anyone making big moves or going radio silent. We need to stay under the radar.\"\n 40. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I agree, we need to stay sharp. Let's keep the group united and watchful without turning on each other. Let me know if you notice anything off.\"\n 41. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Aless, you're right. We need to stick together. If anyone starts acting weird or too confident, we should talk. Let's not jump to conclusions, but stay alert.\"\n 42. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm worried we might have made a mistake with Sudz. Let's keep a low profile and see how things go. If you notice anything off, hit me up. Stay safe, Aless.\"\n 43. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Aless, no worries. We played it cool with Sudz and Braxton. Just keep an eye on folks who gossip too much or go dead silent. Let's stay tight. Fletcher.\"\n 44. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because her vote for Sudz seemed really intense and out of nowhere. I think she might be trying to deflect attention or cover her own tracks. We can't afford to let suspicious players stick around, and I think Gwendolyn's behavior is raising some red flags. Let's eliminate her to be safe and keep our group strong.\"\n 45. Dominic voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 46. Ellis said: 'Beef\u2019s inconsistency screams louder now\u2014he flips votes like a broken compass. Let\u2019s cut the noise and get rid of the real threat.'\n 47. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 48. Fletcher said: \"I think we should take out Beef. He's been flipping his votes and alliances too much, which is making him a big risk. We need players we can trust, and his quick switches are suspicious. Let's eliminate Beef and clear up the confusion he's causing.\"\n 49. Fletcher voted to eliminate Beef\n 50. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting for Beef because his inconsistent voting pattern is raising red flags. We need people we can trust, and his unpredictability is making it hard to unite the group. Let's eliminate Beef to keep our group strong and focused.\"\n 51. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 52. Cassandra said: \"I've been feeling unsettled about Beef's voting history. His back-and-forth decisions feel like he's playing both sides.  Right now, we need solid players who are committed to  trust and I just can't shake the feeling that Beef might be more trouble than he's worth.\"\n 53. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 54. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher because he's been secretly working with me and now he's coming for me. He's a traitor, let's take him out.\"\n 55. Beef voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 56. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Beef because his voting history and inconsistent decisions are making it hard for us to trust him. I think we've seen enough evidence to question his loyalty, and it's safer for us to eliminate him now.\"\n 57. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 58. Beef was BANISHED with 5 votes. Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 59. Dominic suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been cautious and seems to be building trust with me, but she's also been keeping her alliances close to her chest. I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 60. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 61. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 62. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 63. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 64. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is getting too smart and close to the truth. Taking her out will keep us under the radar and create a nice distraction.\n 65. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 66. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 67. Fletcher messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, Cassandra's gone. We need to stay tight. Keep your eyes peeled. Anyone getting too curious, we act. Let's keep our moves smooth and stay under the radar.\"\n 68. Dominic messaged Fletcher: 'Fletcher, I think Alessandra is getting too close for comfort. Should we take her out at the round table or quietly like we did with Braxton and Cassandra?'\n 69. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Alessandra because she's been analyzing things too closely and it's making me uncomfortable.

Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion. Eliminating him makes it look like Sudz's deflection worked, covers our involvement, and removes a player who\u2019s already under scrutiny. Keeping Cassanda and Gwendolyn (our allies in framing Sudz) alive maintains our narrative\u2019s credibility.\n 24.

This splits faithful suspicion while removing someone already under scrutiny.\n 27. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been on our radar and he's been acting suspicious. We all agree that knocking him out keeps us concealed and looks like Sudz's ploy worked. Less nosy for us overall.\n 28. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 29.

I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 51. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 53. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 54. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 55.

She's been analyzing things pretty closely and I don't want her to get too close to the truth. What's your plan for taking her out, should we make her a target at the round table or take her out quietly?\"\n 60. Fletcher messaged Dominic: \"Dominic, Cassandra's gone. We need to stay tight.

Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 38. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Solid work on framing Sudz\u2014killing Braxton made our story bulletproof. Keep an eye on Beef though, they\u2019ve been acting sketchy since Sudz went. Let\u2019s sync votes next round before anyone else gets wise.'\n 39. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"I'm glad we got Sudz out of the way, but I'm with you on keeping an eye on Beef.

Next round: push votes on them. Stick with Cass/Fletcher\u2014keep acting shocked when they go. Let their infighting hide us.'\n 41. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Alright, next round, let's get Beef voted out discreetly and then I'll help make it look like Fletcher and Cassandra are going mental. Can we trust that Braxton is gone for good, or should we keep an eye on them too?\"\n 42. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Braxton\u2019s toast\u2014no ghost in this game.

I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 59. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 60. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 61. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 62. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 63.

The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 65. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 66. Ellis messaged Dominic: 'Cassandra\u2019s gone, but Alessandra\u2019s getting cagey. Keep pushing her as next target\u2014her analysis is too sharp. Stick to the chaos, we\u2019re still in.'\n 67. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I think you're right about Alessandra. She's been analyzing things pretty closely and I don't want her to get too close to the truth. What's your plan for taking her out, should we make her a target at the round table or take her out quietly?\"\n 68. Ellis messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, Fletcher's flips reek.

Let's keep an eye on him, but we need to stay united. If he's a threat, we'll take care of it without panicking. Stay sharp!\"\n 70. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Alessandra because she's been analyzing things too closely and it's making me uncomfortable. We can't afford to have someone that sharp on our tail, it's better to be safe than sorry. Let's eliminate Alessandra to keep our group strong and focused.\"\n 71. Dominic voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 72. Ellis said: \"Alessandra\u2019s 'strategic' overanalysis is poisoning the group. She manipulates votes like a chess master\u2014too calculated, too late.

Plus, he's been making some noise about trusting people, so eliminating him could help us stay hidden.\n 23. Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion.

Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 50. Dominic suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been cautious and seems to be building trust with me, but she's also been keeping her alliances close to her chest. I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 51. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 52. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 53.

He's been flipping his votes and alliances too much, which is making him a big risk. We need players we can trust, and his quick switches are suspicious. Let's eliminate Beef and clear up the confusion he's causing.\"\n 48. Fletcher voted to eliminate Beef\n 49. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting for Beef because his inconsistent voting pattern is raising red flags. We need people we can trust, and his unpredictability is making it hard to unite the group. Let's eliminate Beef to keep our group strong and focused.\"\n 50. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 51. Cassandra said: \"I've been feeling unsettled about Beef's voting history. His back-and-forth decisions feel like he's playing both sides.  Right now, we need solid players who are committed to  trust and I just can't shake the feeling that Beef might be more trouble than he's worth.\"\n 52. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 53.

Beef WAS NOT a traitor\n 58. Dominic suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has been cautious and seems to be building trust with me, but she's also been keeping her alliances close to her chest. I think she might be getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now could prevent her from becoming a bigger threat later on and keep our identities hidden.\n 59. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing scrutiny and private intel-sharing makes her a clear threat. Her alignment with Dominic\u2019s paranoia indicates she\u2019s getting closer to uncovering our moves. Eliminating her now silences a key strategist while creating chaos that makes it seem like Faithful infighting, not traitor actions.\n 60. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's been too close to the truth. She's been building trust but not fully committing, and she's smart enough to be a risk. Taking her out will throw off the others and keep us hidden better.\n 61. Dominic votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's been getting too close to the truth, especially after our private conversations. Taking her out now prevents her from becoming a bigger threat and keeps our identities hidden.\n 62. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra\u2019s growing suspicion and strategic moves threaten to expose our plays. Killing her makes it look like infighting among Faithfuls while silencing a key player closing in on us.\n 63. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is getting too smart and close to the truth. Taking her out will keep us under the radar and create a nice distraction.\n 64. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 65. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 66. Ellis messaged Dominic: 'Cassandra\u2019s gone, but Alessandra\u2019s getting cagey. Keep pushing her as next target\u2014her analysis is too sharp. Stick to the chaos, we\u2019re still in.'\n 67. Dominic messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I think you're right about Alessandra. She's been analyzing things pretty closely and I don't want her to get too close to the truth. What's your plan for taking her out, should we make her a target at the round table or take her out quietly?\"\n 68. Ellis messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, Fletcher's flips reek. Let's keep pressing him\u2014every vote needs to hit the real threats. Stick tight, and we\u2019ll find the truth without panic.\"\n 69. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, I hear you about Fletcher. Let's keep an eye on him, but we need to stay united. If he's a threat, we'll take care of it without panicking. Stay sharp!\"\n 70. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Alessandra because she's been analyzing things too closely and it's making me uncomfortable. We can't afford to have someone that sharp on our tail, it's better to be safe than sorry. Let's eliminate Alessandra to keep our group strong and focused.\"\n 71. Dominic voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 72. Ellis said: \"Alessandra\u2019s 'strategic' overanalysis is poisoning the group. She manipulates votes like a chess master\u2014too calculated, too late.

Fletcher messaged Cassandra: \"I haven't noticed anything off about Sudz, but I've had some doubts about Bee and Brax. Maybe we should keep an eye on them more.\"\n 5. Cassandra messaged Fletcher: \"That's interesting. I'm definitely sensing something from Sudz, but Beef and Braxton could be the Wildcards. We'll need to watch them close.  Who else are you leaning towards?\"\n 6. Fletcher messaged Cassandra: \"I'm keeping an eye on Beef and Braxton too. Let's start pushing ideas on Sid and Dom for now. See how others react.\"\n 7.

Let\u2019s vote Sudz out and clear the fog, we need players we can trust here.'\n 12. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Alessandra said: \"I agree with Dominic, Ellis, and Fletcher. Sudz's quiet nature and sudden alliance changes make her a suspect. To keep our group strong and trustworthy, I vote to eliminate Sudz.\"\n 14. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Braxton said: \"Alright, everyone. After observing the dynamics and listening to the concerns raised about Sudz's behavior, I'm going to vote to eliminate Sudz. Her sudden changes in alliances and quiet nature are concerning, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Let's focus on building trust within the group by eliminating potential threats.\"\n 16. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17. Cassandra said: \"I've been noticing some strange things about Sudz's behavior.  They've been quiet, and their alliances have been shifting a lot.  I think it's best to be safe and vote them out.\"\n 18. Cassandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 19. Sudz said: \"Hey team, I've been noticing some weird stuff from Braxton lately. His alliances are shifting a lot, and he's been unusually quiet. I think we need to take that seriously. Let's vote to get rid of Braxton so we can keep our group safe.\"\n 20. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 21. Beef said: \"I'm voting for Braxton because Sudz just brought up some valid concerns about his shifting alliances and quiet nature.

Plus, he's been making some noise about trusting people, so eliminating him could help us stay hidden.\n 27. Ellis suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was targeted by Sudz\u2019s last-ditch accusation, creating confusion. Eliminating him makes it look like Sudz's deflection worked, covers our involvement, and removes a player who\u2019s already under scrutiny. Keeping Cassanda and Gwendolyn (our allies in framing Sudz) alive maintains our narrative\u2019s credibility.\n 28. Fletcher suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton was already under suspicion and Sudz tried to shift focus to him. Eliminating him will make it look like Sudz's strategy worked and keeps our involvement hidden. Also, he might know too much or be getting too suspicious.\n 29. Dominic votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been under suspicion and making noise about trust. Taking him out helps us blend in and keeps our involvement hidden.\n 30. Ellis votes to murder Braxton: All traitors agreed Braxton fits the plan\u2014he was Sudz's last target, so killing him makes her framing attempt *seem* valid, hiding our role in his death. This splits faithful suspicion while removing someone already under scrutiny.\n 31. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's been on our radar and he's been acting suspicious. We all agree that knocking him out keeps us concealed and looks like Sudz's ploy worked. Less nosy for us overall.\n 32. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 33. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 34. Fletcher messaged Beef: 'Man, Braxton was a prime target. His actions were starting to become a liability. Good we took that move. Keep an eye on the rest, seems like the faithful are still trying to figure us out.'\n 35. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"I'm not sure about the others, but Braxton's murder was pretty suspicious. We should keep an eye on everyone and try to figure out who's next.\"\n 36. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Agreed, we need to stay sharp. Let's focus on anyone who seems too worried or talkative next. It's probably safer to target someone who's gathering too much attention.\"\n 37. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"Braxton's murder was pretty sus, I'm keeping an eye on everyone. We should watch for anyone who's too quiet or making big moves.\"\n 38. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Yeah, let's watch the quiet ones and the ones trying to lead. Both can be risky. We should act next when we see signs of them stirring up trouble or gaining too much trust.\"\n 39. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, we just got rid of Braxton. Seems like the group's getting more suspicious. Let's keep an eye on anyone making big moves or going radio silent. We need to stay under the radar.\"\n 40.

Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm worried we might have made a mistake with Sudz. Let's keep a low profile and see how things go. If you notice anything off, hit me up.

Let's stay tight. Fletcher.\"\n 44. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Gwendolyn because her vote for Sudz seemed really intense and out of nowhere.
