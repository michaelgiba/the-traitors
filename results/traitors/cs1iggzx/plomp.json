Let's not give her time to guess our moves. Killing two birds with one stone by keeping Dominic on our side too.\"\n 60. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Dominic\u2019s been flipping votes too fast. Let\u2019s keep pressure on him while we handle Braxton\u2019s antics. Trust your gut on his weirdness but keep focus on the bigger picture. Teamwork now matters most.'\n 61. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"I agree Dominic's been shifting a lot, but let's focus on Braxton first. His finger-pointing feels like a classic distraction move. Let's take him out and see what happens.\"\n 62. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Smart call on Braxton\u2014his constant accusations are a red flag. Let\u2019s push his elimination today, but keep an ear on Dominic\u2019s shifts. If he wavers again after Braxton\u2019s gone, we\u2019ll corner him next. Team focus: Braxton first, then regroup.

Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"I'm with you on Braxton, his finger-pointing is classic misdirection. Let's take him out first, then we can focus on Dominic if he keeps flipping. Trust your instincts, Ellis.\"\n 65. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Agreed, Braxton\u2019s theatrics need to stop. Let\u2019s rally Dominic & Fletcher behind his elimination\u2014after he\u2019s gone, we isolate Dominic\u2019s shifts. Stick together, but don\u2019t let him see us aligning too tight. Play along if others question, but Braxton\u2019s gone first. Trust the flow?'\n 66. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.

Ellis said: 'I agree with Braxton\u2014Beef\u2019s constantly trying to smooth things over. People who act *too* nice usually have something to hide. Let\u2019s eliminate them before they sabotage us all.'\n 9. Ellis voted to eliminate Beef\n 10. Fletcher said: 'I agree with Braxton and Ellis. Beef has been acting way too eager to get everyone to agree. It\u2019s making me think they might be trying a little too hard to fit in. Better safe than sorry, let\u2019s eliminate them now.'\n 11. Fletcher voted to eliminate Beef\n 12. Alessandra said: \"I'm going to vote for Beef. I know Braxton and Ellis brought up some good points about Beef seeming too eager.

I'm hoping we're making the right choice here.\"\n 13. Alessandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 14. Cassandra said: \"I've been thinking hard about this, and while Beef seemed a little too agreeable, Braxton's been playing it too close to the vest all game. Doesn't feel natural, ya know?

Sudz said: \"I've been listening in on some conversations, and Ellis has been pushing for everyone to agree on everything. It's almost like they're trying too hard to be liked by everyone.

Ellis said: 'Sudz\u2019s sudden attack on me last round felt way too personal and desperate. They\u2019re pushing too hard to shift focus everywhere.

Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 43. Sudz said: \"Folks, I've noticed Ellis pushing for everyone to agree, too much for my liking.

Braxton suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn has been less vocal and hasn't targeted the traitors, making her a safer target to maintain our cover without raising suspicion.\n 49.

Let's not give her time to guess our moves. Killing two birds with one stone by keeping Dominic on our side too.\"\n 59. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra. She's been too quiet and hasn't really contributed much to our discussions. Her lack of involvement makes me think she might be hiding something. We should take her out to see what's really going on.\"\n 60. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 61. Ellis said: \"'Alessandra's flip-flopping between suspects is reckless.

Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 63. Fletcher said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Alessandra. She flipped so fast on Braxton just moments after rallying for him. That's not natural.
