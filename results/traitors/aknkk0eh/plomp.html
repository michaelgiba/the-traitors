Alessandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been active in discussions and could become a threat if he figures out the traitors. Removing him now weakens the faithful's coordination.\n 27. Ellis suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher is highly observant and actively called out traitorous behavior, making him a strategic threat. Silencing him weakens the group's ability to identify remaining traitors and maintains confusion among Faithfuls.\n 28. Alessandra votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher's been super active and might figure out we're traitors. Better take him out now before he exposes us.\n 29. Ellis votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is actively analyzing behavior and voting patterns, making him a direct threat to traitor secrecy. Eliminating him now disrupts Faithful coordination and silences a key identifier.\n 30. The traitors have decided to murder Fletcher\n 31. Fletcher was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 32. Braxton messaged Alessandra: \"Alright, Alessandra, I just want to say I think we made the right call with Gwendolyn. Her switch was too quick. Now that Fletcher is gone, we need to be extra careful.

Sudz said: \"I have reservations about Braxton's recent actions. His attempt to eliminate me was unnecessary, and his quick dismissal of my vote as irrelevant shows a dismissive attitude that I cannot align with.

Removing her takes down the Faithful's best strategist, sowing confusion.\n 49. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp analytical skills make her a big threat. Eliminating her removes a key strategist for the Faithfuls and helps protect us from being exposed.\n 50. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's analytical skills threaten to unravel our plans.

Alessandra said: \"Dominic's been way too eager with his votes, and that kind of behavior makes me think he's hiding something. I'm voting to eliminate Dominic because I believe he might be a traitor trying to throw us off. Let's shake things up and see how the group reacts.\"\n 45. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 46. Ellis said: 'Dominic\u2019s overly eager voting sprees and need to \u2018protect Sudz\u2019 scream cover-up.

Sudz said: \"I have reservations about Braxton's recent actions. His attempt to eliminate me was unnecessary, and his quick dismissal of my vote as irrelevant shows a dismissive attitude that I cannot align with.

Removing him eliminates a threat and keeps the group less likely to suspect me.\n 60. Ellis suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp analytical skills and history of calling out traitors' moves (like exposing Gwendolyn) make her most dangerous. Removing her takes down the Faithful's best strategist, sowing confusion.\n 61. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp analytical skills make her a big threat. Eliminating her removes a key strategist for the Faithfuls and helps protect us from being exposed.\n 62. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's analytical skills threaten to unravel our plans.

Let's take him out next to weaken the Faithfuls and keep our cover safe.\"\n 68. Alessandra said: \"Sudz has been pretty quiet, but the comments he's made are sharp. I'm worried he's seeing things we're not, and that unpredictability can hurt us. Let's eliminate him before he becomes a bigger threat.\"\n 69. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 70. Ellis said: 'Sudz\u2019s silence after Cassandra\u2019s death is way too calculated. They\u2019re mirroring Gwendolyn\u2019s old tactics\u2014sneaking around without accountability. Vote Sudz out NOW before they pull another fast one like last time.'\n 71. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 72. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been too quiet and unpredictable.

Alessandra suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton has been active and suspicious, likely to uncover us. Eliminating him weakens the Faithfuls and keeps us safer.\n 80.

Ellis votes to END_GAME: Dominic and others we've eliminated were clearly hiding agendas. It's better to secure the pot now before any more unpredictable threats escalate. We've seen who's been honest and loyal here.\n 87. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there are any traitors left, and I don't want to risk ending the game with a traitor still in play. We need to eliminate the last traitor to win the pot. Let's eliminate one more person to be sure.\n 88. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: Ending the game now ensures we secure the win as traitors without further risks. Continuing could lead to complications or potential elimination.\n 89. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 90. Beef said: \"Ellis has been too pushy and aggressive, trying to eliminate people quickly.

Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 11. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn's sudden flip from Sudz to Ellis is raising some red flags for me. It feels like she's trying to manipulate the vote and might be hiding something. We need to root out potential traitors early on, and I think Gwendolyn is a big risk right now.\"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 13. Dominic said: \"I think Sudz has been really quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions. Given the high stakes, I'd rather eliminate someone who's not showing their hand. It's not about being suspicious, it's about taking a cautious approach to protect the group.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing the group's dynamics and noticed an unusual shift in focus.
