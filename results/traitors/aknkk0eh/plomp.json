They're pretty vocal and in agreement with Alessandra's assessment of Sudz, which makes me think they might be in cahoots. Let's see if we can flush them out.\"\n 12. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 13. Braxton said: \"Alright, I've been watching Gwendolyn closely. Her sudden shift in focus from Sudz to Ellis is suspicious. If she's a traitor, she might be trying to eliminate a potential leader or someone who's too influential. I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn to protect the group.\"\n 14. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 15. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn's sudden flip from Sudz to Ellis is raising some red flags for me.

Alessandra votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher's been super active and might figure out we're traitors. Better take him out now before he exposes us.\n 29. Ellis votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is actively analyzing behavior and voting patterns, making him a direct threat to traitor secrecy.

Let's focus on Cassandra and Dominic next\u2014they both pushed hard for Gwendolyn's elimination, which could mean they're hiding something.

Safety in numbers, right?\"\n 35. Alessandra messaged Braxton: \"I agree with you on Cassandra and Dominic. Their push against Gwendolyn does seem suspicious.

Let's keep a close watch on him in the next round.\"\n 38. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"I agree, Dominic's voting pattern last round was a little too eager, like he was trying to steer things a certain way.  I'll definitely be keeping an eye on him.  Also,  we need to figure out how many traitors there are.\"\n 39. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, yeah Dominic's been acting a bit off with his votes. I'm keeping an eye on him for sure. But Ellis has also been pretty vocal, don't you think? Maybe they're working together or just trying to hide something. What's your take on Ellis?\"\n 40.

Sudz said: \"I have reservations about Braxton's recent actions. His attempt to eliminate me was unnecessary, and his quick dismissal of my vote as irrelevant shows a dismissive attitude that I cannot align with.

Ellis said: 'Sudz\u2019s silence after Cassandra\u2019s death is way too calculated. They\u2019re mirroring Gwendolyn\u2019s old tactics\u2014sneaking around without accountability.

Alessandra said: \"I think we should eliminate Sudz. They've been pretty quiet and haven't really contributed much to the discussions. It's hard to read them, and in a game like this, that kind of unpredictability can be dangerous. Let's see how this plays out.\"\n 4. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 5. Ellis said: \"I agree, Sudz hasn't engaged much. Quietness isn\u2019t a crime, but in a game this high-stakes, I\u2019d rather eliminate someone who\u2019s not showing loyalty to anyone. Let\u2019s cut ties with them.\"\n 6. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 7. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm gonna go with Ellis. They're pretty vocal and in agreement with Alessandra's assessment of Sudz, which makes me think they might be in cahoots. Let's see if we can flush them out.\"\n 8. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 9. Braxton said: \"Alright, I've been watching Gwendolyn closely. Her sudden shift in focus from Sudz to Ellis is suspicious. If she's a traitor, she might be trying to eliminate a potential leader or someone who's too influential. I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn to protect the group.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 11. Cassandra said: \"Gwendolyn's sudden flip from Sudz to Ellis is raising some red flags for me. It feels like she's trying to manipulate the vote and might be hiding something. We need to root out potential traitors early on, and I think Gwendolyn is a big risk right now.\"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 13. Dominic said: \"I think Sudz has been really quiet and hasn't contributed much to our discussions. Given the high stakes, I'd rather eliminate someone who's not showing their hand. It's not about being suspicious, it's about taking a cautious approach to protect the group.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Sudz said: \"I've been closely observing the group's dynamics and noticed an unusual shift in focus. Gwendolyn's sudden change from supporting the elimination of Sudz to pushing for Ellis as a threat seems suspicious. It appears to be an attempt at manipulation.

Beef said: \"Gwendolyn's sudden change in vote from Sudz to Ellis was fishy. Braxton and Cassandra also called her out, so I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn.\"\n 18.

Alessandra suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been active in discussions and could become a threat if he figures out the traitors. Removing him now weakens the faithful's coordination.\n 23.

Silencing him weakens the group's ability to identify remaining traitors and maintains confusion among Faithfuls.\n 24. Alessandra votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher's been super active and might figure out we're traitors. Better take him out now before he exposes us.\n 25. Ellis votes to murder Fletcher: Fletcher is actively analyzing behavior and voting patterns, making him a direct threat to traitor secrecy. Eliminating him now disrupts Faithful coordination and silences a key identifier.\n 26. The traitors have decided to murder Fletcher\n 27. Fletcher was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I'm getting a bit concerned about Dominic. He's been pretty vocal and seemed really eager to eliminate Gwendolyn. I wonder if he's trying to hide something or just really into the game. What's your take on him?\"\n 29. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Dominic\u2019s steadfastness reeks of cover-up. If he\u2019s clinging to Sudz\u2019s path despite our clear traitor found, he\u2019s hiding something. Let\u2019s zero in on him next\u2014it\u2019ll scare the Faithful into chaos.'\n 30. Alessandra messaged Ellis: \"I'm with you on that Ellis. Dominic's been way too eager to push those votes, and it does seem like he's hiding something. Let's make him the target next\u2014it'll definitely shake things up and keep everyone on their toes.\"\n 31. Ellis messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, hit Dominic next. Amplify Sudz's 'innocence' in talk\u2014faithful'll chase rabbits while we tighten the vise.\"\n 32. Alessandra said: \"Dominic's been way too eager with his votes, and that kind of behavior makes me think he's hiding something.

Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 36. Braxton said: \"I think Dominic's been too eager to eliminate others, and that's not normal. He could be a traitor trying to cover his tracks.

He's been super eager to vote people out from the start.  It feels like he's trying to control the narrative and  I'm getting bad vibes from his pushiness. \"\n 39. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 40. Dominic said: \"Alessandra's been making big moves, voting for people like Sudz and now me. I think she's trying too hard to be a leader. Her sudden concerns about my voting seem like a smokescreen. Let's eliminate the person who's pushing too hard.\"\n 41. Dominic voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 42. Sudz said: \"I have reservations about Braxton's recent actions. His attempt to eliminate me was unnecessary, and his quick dismissal of my vote as irrelevant shows a dismissive attitude that I cannot align with. His aggressive stance against my concerns suggests he might not be as committed to our cause as he claims. I believe we need to eliminate Braxton for the safety and integrity of our group.\"\n 43. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 44. Beef said: \"Dominic's been too eager to vote, it's suspicious. I'm voting to eliminate him to keep the group safe.\"\n 45. Beef voted to eliminate Dominic\n 46.

Removing her takes down the Faithful's best strategist, sowing confusion.\n 49. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's sharp analytical skills make her a big threat. Eliminating her removes a key strategist for the Faithfuls and helps protect us from being exposed.\n 50. Ellis votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's analytical skills threaten to unravel our plans.

We need to act now\u2014vote him next before he figures us out.'\n 57. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I'm not sure about Sudz, but we need to be cautious.
