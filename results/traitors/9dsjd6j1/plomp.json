If we end it now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get the majority of the prize. I want to make sure we have a fair chance at winning.\n 47. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 48.

Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 50.

Can you share what made you vote to eliminate Morgan? I'm trying to figure out where everyone's heads are at.\"\n 37. Taylor said: \"I think Riley's been following the crowd a bit too closely. They voted to eliminate Gwendolyn and Morgan without really stating their own reasons. I want to see more independent thought from Riley before I trust them completely.

Riley said: \"Taylor's been questioning my decisions and actions, and I think it's because they're trying to deflect from their own gameplay.

With only four of us left, I think it's crucial to ensure we eliminate any remaining traitors before ending the game. If we end it now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get the majority of the prize. I want to make sure we have a fair chance at winning.\n 50. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 51. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We've still got a few loose ends. We need to be 100% sure that all traitors are gone before we end this.

Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 56. Parker said: \"I believe Casey's behavior during the game has been somewhat evasive and inconsistent. Initially, they seemed to trust me, but later, they quickly aligned with Taylor's suspicions. This sudden change in stance doesn't sit well with me. I'm convinced that Casey might still be harboring secret motives or even playing the game more than we're aware of. So, I vote to eliminate Casey.\"\n 57. Parker voted to eliminate Casey\n 58.

Taylor said: \"I think Riley's been following the crowd a bit too closely. They voted to eliminate Gwendolyn and Morgan without really stating their own reasons. I want to see more independent thought from Riley before I trust them completely.  I think it's important we have people who are willing to stand up for their beliefs, even if it's not the most popular stance.\"\n 37. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 38. Riley said: \"Taylor's been questioning my decisions and actions, and I think it's because they're trying to deflect from their own gameplay.

With only four of us left, I think it's crucial to ensure we eliminate any remaining traitors before ending the game. If we end it now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get the majority of the prize. I want to make sure we have a fair chance at winning.\n 49. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 50.

They've been going with the flow, but I think they might be hiding something. I'd rather take a chance on eliminating them now than risk them being a traitor later.\"\n 54. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 55. Parker said: \"I believe Casey's behavior during the game has been somewhat evasive and inconsistent. Initially, they seemed to trust me, but later, they quickly aligned with Taylor's suspicions. This sudden change in stance doesn't sit well with me. I'm convinced that Casey might still be harboring secret motives or even playing the game more than we're aware of. So, I vote to eliminate Casey.\"\n 56. Parker voted to eliminate Casey\n 57.

Even though there's a risk that there might still be a traitor among us, ending the game now will prevent any one traitor from winning the entire prize pool.

Their support for Morgan initially, followed by a swift vote against Morgan after Morgan targeted Taylor, makes me question Taylor's consistency and their motives in the game. I believe their actions warrant further scrutiny, and I'm inclined to vote to eliminate Taylor to prevent any hidden agenda from influencing the outcome of the game.\"\n 33.

Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 54.
