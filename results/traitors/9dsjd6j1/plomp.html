If we end the game and there's a traitor, they'll get nothing. I'd rather take that risk and split the prize among us if we're all faithful. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n 65. Parker votes to END_GAME: I've eliminated two players with no way to be certain who might still be a traitor. To protect the interests of the remaining faithful, I'm choosing to end the game. Even though there's a risk that there might still be a traitor among us, ending the game now will prevent any one traitor from winning the entire prize pool. This way, we ensure that all the faithful get an equal share of the money, minimizing the chance that a single traitor benefits from betraying the others.\n 66.

Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 54.

Let's watch Riley as well, but for now, I think we need to get rid of Taylor.\"\n 43. Fletcher voted to eliminate Taylor\n 44. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because they've been inconsistent with their votes and actions. They've quickly changed their stance on Morgan and now are accusing others of being traitors without solid evidence. I think it's time to eliminate the risk and get someone who's more steady.\"\n 45. Casey voted to eliminate Taylor\n 46. Taylor was BANISHED with 4 votes. Taylor WAS NOT a traitor\n 47. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 48. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that we've found all the traitors yet. With only four of us left, I think it's crucial to ensure we eliminate any remaining traitors before ending the game. If we end it now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get the majority of the prize. I want to make sure we have a fair chance at winning.\n 49. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Riley, I've been thinking about the endgame strategy. With four players left, there's a risk that a single traitor could still be among us, meaning the faithful would walk away with nothing. I believe it's important to take that risk and continue playing to potentially expose all traitors. If we end the game and there's still a traitor among the faithful, it would be unfair and could cost us the entire prize pool. By continuing to play, we're giving ourselves a better chance to split the prize among the faithful and ensure a fair and complete elimination of the traitors.\n 50. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We've still got a few loose ends. We need to be 100% sure that all traitors are gone before we end this. I don't want to risk giving everything to the traitors by ending too early.\n 51. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. With only four players left, we need to be cautious and ensure we eliminate any remaining traitors before ending the game. If we end it now and there's still a traitor, they'll win the prize.\n 52. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 53. Riley said: \"Casey's been playing it safe, but I'm not convinced of their loyalty. They've been going with the flow, but I think they might be hiding something. I'd rather take a chance on eliminating them now than risk them being a traitor later.\"\n 54. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 55. Parker said: \"I believe Casey's behavior during the game has been somewhat evasive and inconsistent. Initially, they seemed to trust me, but later, they quickly aligned with Taylor's suspicions. This sudden change in stance doesn't sit well with me. I'm convinced that Casey might still be harboring secret motives or even playing the game more than we're aware of. So, I vote to eliminate Casey.\"\n 56. Parker voted to eliminate Casey\n 57. Fletcher said: \"I think Casey has been too careful and hasn't shown clear reasoning for their votes. Their change of heart when voting just makes me uneasy. I think we should eliminate Casey to be sure.\"\n 58. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 59. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley because they've been following the crowd too closely without providing their own reasoning, and now they're targeting me without solid evidence. I think they're being too reactive rather than leading the conversation, and that's suspicious to me.\"\n 60. Casey voted to eliminate Riley\n 61. Casey was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 62. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 63. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because I'm not sure if we can trust each other. We've eliminated a few people, but there's still a chance that one of us is a traitor. If we end the game and there's a traitor, they'll get nothing. I'd rather take that risk and split the prize among us if we're all faithful. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n 64. Parker votes to END_GAME: I've eliminated two players with no way to be certain who might still be a traitor. To protect the interests of the remaining faithful, I'm choosing to end the game. Even though there's a risk that there might still be a traitor among us, ending the game now will prevent any one traitor from winning the entire prize pool. This way, we ensure that all the faithful get an equal share of the money, minimizing the chance that a single traitor benefits from betraying the others.\n 65. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We've still got some questions about each other. I'd rather risk voting out one more person to be 100% sure we're all faithful before splitting the pot. We can't afford to leave any room for doubt.\n 66. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 67. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher because they're still hesitant to end the game. They want to risk eliminating one more person to be 100% sure, but I think that's an unnecessary risk. Parker and I have already decided to end the game, and I believe we should trust each other. Fletcher's insistence on continuing the game makes me question their motives. Are they trying to protect someone or hide something? I'd rather take the chance with Parker and split the prize now than risk losing everything.\"\n 68. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 69. Parker said: \"Fletcher, while I understand your hesitance to end the game, I believe it's time to take a decisive step to ensure the safety of our faithfulness. Your behavior has been somewhat evasive, and your sudden change of heart when aligning with Taylor raises suspicion. I want to trust the process we've established and protect us from any hidden agendas. I vote to eliminate Fletcher and continue the game with the remaining players, as we cannot afford to leave any room for doubt.\"\n 70.
