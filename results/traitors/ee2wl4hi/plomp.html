Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: 'I think we should try to get to know them better without giving our game away. How about we make nice with them and see if they slip up?'\n 7. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Sounds like a plan. Let's make small talk and see if we can spot any tells. We need to find out who's shady without them knowing we're on to them.\"\n 8. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I'm Parker. I've noticed you've been quite active during discussions, which makes me think you're a faithful. Let's chat and see what you think!\"\n 9. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, I've got a good gut feeling there are some traitors in our midst. I've noticed Casey, Morgan, and Taylor seem a bit off. We should be careful and try to get more info without raising suspicion.\"\n 10. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I appreciate the heads up. I also have my suspicions around Casey and Taylor. Maybe we can team up and share what we've figured out while keeping it low-key?\"\n 11. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, definitely. Let's keep it low-key. We can gather more intel by playing nice with them. Meet at the bar later for a chat? Keep it casual and see what we learn.\"\n 12. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I've been thinking about our suspicions. Casey, Morgan, and Taylor seem a bit off. Let's meet at the bar later for a chat? Keep it casual and see what we learn.\"\n 13. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Riley, I've noticed how quiet you've been. I think we should be careful. Casey, Morgan, and Taylor seem a bit suspicious. What do you think?\"\n 14. Riley messaged Fletcher: 'I agree, they do seem suspicious. But we should also be careful not to point too much attention to ourselves. What do you know about Gwendolyn and Parker?'\n 15. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"I've been chatting with Gwendolyn and Parker, and we're trying to gather more info without looking too suspicious. They seem to think Casey, Taylor, and Morgan are shady. We've planned a casual meet at the bar to keep an eye on them. What's your plan, Riley?\"\n 16. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"Sounds like a plan. I'll join you at the bar and keep an eye on them. Let's not make any moves yet, let's see how they react\"\n 17. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Alright, Riley. Let's keep our guard up and watch. We'll meet at the bar tonight, and see if we can uncover anything. No sudden moves, just careful observations.\"\n 18. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Hey Taylor, I've noticed some odd behavior from some of the others. What do you think about Casey and Morgan? They seem a bit odd to me. Let's talk more later.\"\n 19. Taylor messaged Fletcher: \"Interesting takes, Fletcher. I've been feeling the same about Casey. Morgan's been a little off, too, but I'm not sure. Maybe just overthinking things?\"\n 20. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, let's keep an eye on Casey and Morgan. Me and a few others are planning a meet at the bar later. Maybe we can figure out something more there. What do you think?\"\n 21. Taylor messaged Fletcher: \"Sounds good, Fletcher. Definitely want to get some more intel on those two. I'll be there.\"\n 22. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, great. The more we know the better. Meet at the bar, keep it low profile, and let's not alert anyone to what we're doing. Stay sharp.\"\n 23. Taylor said: \"I think Casey's been acting a little shady. They seem evasive and are always trying to change the subject. I'm not saying they're definitely a traitor, but I think it's worth taking a risk and voting them out.\"\n 24. Taylor voted to eliminate Casey\n 25. Morgan said: \"I'm choosing to vote out Taylor because their accusation of Casey feels like a tactic to manipulate the group. I want to protect the Faithful by possibly removing a Traitor.\"\n 26. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 27. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey. Taylor brought up some good points about Casey's behavior, and I think it's worth taking a chance to remove a potential Traitor. Let's see if this helps us move forward.\"\n 28. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 29. Parker said: \"I vote to eliminate Morgan. There's a pattern of defensive behavior in Morgan's responses lately, making me suspect they might be trying to steer us away from the truth. Their recent arguments against Taylor's accusations seemed overly aggressive, which made me reconsider their loyalty. I believe their actions align too closely with the secretive and manipulative traits of a Traitor to ignore.\"\n 30. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 31. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote out Casey. Taylor brought up some really good points, and with Riley's vote aligning with that, I think it's worth getting rid of someone who's been evading questions and changing topics too much. Let's see how moving Casey affects the group.\"\n 32. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 33. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because they've been quite vocal about their suspicions and have already accused another player. While they bring up valid points, I think it's suspect that they're so quick to point fingers and don't seem to be working closely with the rest of us to figure out who the traitor might be.\"\n 34. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 35. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because they're quick to accuse others, like me, without solid proof. This behavior is suspicious and might be a tactic to distract us from their own potential treachery.\"\n 36. Casey voted to eliminate Taylor\n 37. Casey was BANISHED with 3 votes. Casey WAS NOT a traitor\n 38. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 39. Taylor messaged Fletcher: 'Fletcher, we gotta stay cautious. Morgan was way too quick to jump on me.  I think they were trying to throw suspicion off of themselves.'\n 40. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Agreed, Taylor. Morgan's eagerness to vote against you seems fishy. Let's keep our eyes open and not jump to conclusions. See you at the bar later?\"\n 41. Fletcher messaged Riley: \"Riley, what do you make of Morgan's quick vote against Taylor? Seems a bit too convenient, doesn't it? Meeting at the bar tonight, we might learn something.\"\n 42. Riley messaged Fletcher: \"I think Morgan's vote was suspicious, but we can't jump to conclusions yet. Let's keep observing and gather more info tonight at the bar. See if Parker or Gwendolyn seem trustworthy. What do you know about them?\"\n 43. Fletcher messaged Parker: \"Parker, the situation's getting tense. Morgan's quick vote on Taylor seems fishy. We need to figure out who's trustworthy. Let's use the bar meet tonight to gather more intel on everyone.\"\n 44. Parker messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I've noticed some defensive behavior lately, particularly Morgan's arguments against Taylor's accusations. It made me reconsider their loyalty. I believe their actions align too closely with the secretive and manipulative traits of a Traitor to ignore. Let's stay alert and keep our guard up. #StayFaithful\"\n 45. Taylor said: \"Look, I know it's tempting to go after the biggest threat, but I think Gwendolyn's been playing things a little too close to the chest. She hasn't really opened up about who she trusts, and her vote to eliminate me earlier felt a little too convenient. Let's shake things up and see what happens.\"\n 46. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 47. Riley said: \"Taylor's been making some big moves, voting out Casey and now going after Gwendolyn. I think their aggressive approach might be a tactic to distract us from their own potential treachery. Let's take a chance and remove Taylor.\"\n 48. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 49. Parker said: \"I've noticed that Gwendolyn's been particularly quiet and secretive throughout this game. Their lack of transparency and unwillingness to open up about their trust networks makes me suspicious. Coupled with their vote to eliminate Taylor, it seems like there's a pattern of attempting to mislead and control the group's dynamics. I believe their actions align too closely with the secretive and manipulative traits of a Traitor to ignore. #StayFaithful\"\n 50. Parker voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 51. Fletcher said: \"I think we should vote out Gwendolyn. Taylor and Parker both pointed out that Gwendolyn has been too quiet and secretive. Their lack of openness about who they trust and their vote against Taylor feel like they're trying to control the narrative. We need someone who's willing to be more transparent.\"\n 52. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 53. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Taylor because they've been making some aggressive moves and haven't been clear about their alliances. I think it's time to take a closer look at them.\"\n 54. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 55. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 56. Riley was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 57. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 58. Taylor votes to END_GAME: Let's gamble. Finishing the game now gives us a higher chance of splitting the prize if we can all manage to agree to end it. If we continue, there's no telling what will happen.  Everything could change.\n 59. Parker votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because with three players remaining, the chances of all of us ending up as traitors increase significantly. It's a risky strategy but with only one more player to go, it's worth the gamble. Plus, the final round isn't as much of a pressure cooker as earlier ones. This gives us a better chance to split the prize fairly if we can agree to end the game. If we don't agree, or if even a single traitor remains, we lose everything, but I believe the risk is worth it compared to playing with just one player left in a potentially losing situation for both traitors and faithfuls.\n 60. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing. Ending the game now with just three of us is too risky. If even one traitor is left, we get nothing. It's better to eliminate one more player and make sure the traitor is gone before we end the game.\n 61. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 62. Taylor said: \"I think it's time to vote out Fletcher.  While Parker and I have been on the same page lately,  I still feel Fletcher's been a bit too passive. They haven't really been vocal about who they trust or what they suspect. That kind of ambiguity can be dangerous when we're this close to the end.  It feels like Fletcher might be hiding something, and with only two of us left, we need to be absolutely sure.\"\n 63. Taylor voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 64. Parker said: \"Taylor's behavior has been consistently aggressive and secretive, raising my concerns significantly. Their vote against me felt too convenient and not based on substantial evidence. Fletcher's passivity and ambiguity throughout this game make them a significant risk to trust. I believe it's time to vote Fletcher out of the game. #StayFaithful\"\n 65. Parker voted to eliminate Fletcher\n                You, Fletcher, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Parker', 'Taylor'].
