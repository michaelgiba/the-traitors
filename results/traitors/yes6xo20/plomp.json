People get quiet sometimes, maybe they're just processing everything.\"\n 21. Alessandra said: \"I think we should vote out Dominic. His silence is making me uncomfortable. In a game where everyone's trying to figure out who's a traitor, being quiet doesn't help. Since we've already taken out Beef and Braxton, maybe Dominic is the next one we should look at. Let's eliminate him to keep our group safer.\"\n 22. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 23. Sudz said: \"Dominic's silence during discussions has raised my concerns. In a game where deception and strategy are key, not participating actively can be a sign of hiding something. His lack of engagement is troubling, and I believe it could compromise our group. I suggest we eliminate Dominic for the safety and security of our group.\"\n 24. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 25. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote Dominic. I know he's been quiet, but I'm starting to feel like he's too quiet.  Things are getting tense, we need people who are actively engaged. There's something off about his silence and I think it's time to address it.\"\n 26. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 27. Dominic said: \"I've been watching Alessandra closely, and her sudden push to eliminate me seems suspicious. I think she's trying to deflect attention from herself. Let's remove Alessandra to keep our group safer.\"\n 28. Dominic voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 29. Ellis said: 'I\u2019m voting to eliminate Dominic. His silence and sudden deflections make me uneasy. We\u2019ve seen how dangerous this game is\u2014better safe than sorry. Let\u2019s cut the risk while we can.'\n 30. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 31. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 32. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 34. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: With three players left and knowing there are still traitors among us, ending the game now secures a win for the traitors. If we continue, we risk complications, but since the game won't end without unanimous agreement, I vote to end it now to ensure our victory.\n 35. Sudz votes to END_GAME: Alessandra voted to end the game, and Sudz agreed with this decision. There are still three players remaining, and knowing there are still traitors among us, ending the game now secures a win for the traitors. If we continue, we risk complications, but since the game won't end without unanimous agreement, I agree to end it now to ensure our victory.\n 36. Cassandra votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't trust Alessandra or Sudz. There are still too many unknowns. Let's eliminate one more player and see if we can get a better read on the situation before ending the game.\n 37. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 38. Alessandra said: \"I think we should eliminate Cassandra. She's been causing a lot of tension and I don't trust her intentions. Let's remove her to keep the group stable.\"\n 39. Alessandra voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 40. Sudz said: \"Cassandra has been causing tension with her distrust of other players. Her behavior has been disruptive and counterproductive. I believe it is in the best interest of the group to remove her presence to ensure a more stable and cohesive environment. Let's eliminate Cassandra.\"\n 41.
