I think since they didn't have a strong reason for voting Parker out, they might actually be a loyal ally, but I need to make sure. Taking Riley out will not affect my alliance yet and I can keep an eye on the others.\n 20. Gwendolyn votes to murder Morgan: I choose Morgan because as Parker pointed out, Morgan was pretty quiet throughout the game. On top of that, the fact that Fletcher pointed out Parker's vote on Morgan was a distraction and that I've noticed before Parker often brings up suspicions about others, makes me think they're in on it together.

Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since I'm the sole traitor left, if we end the game now, my fellow traitor Casey and I will split the pot evenly. If we continue playing, it's likely that Casey will be eliminated next, and I'll have the chance to take out the remaining player. However, if that player guesses correctly or we fail to murder a faithful again, I risk losing the game. So, it's in my best interest to end the game quickly and avoid any potential risks.\n 35. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing. If we end this now with just three of us left, and there's even the chance that Gwendolyn is a traitor, we'd all get nothing. I trust we can figure out who might be a traitor and eliminate them before we end the game.\n 36. Casey votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because as a faithful, I need to consider the risk of continuing. If Gwendolyn is a traitor and we continue, I might get eliminated. Since I'm not sure who's a traitor, ending the game is a safer bet for me. However, I am actually a traitor, so this works out perfectly as Gwendolyn is also a traitor, and we'll split the pot.\n 37. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 38. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher has been quiet this whole game, and I think they're just flying under the radar to stay safe.

Casey messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I don't know who the traitors are yet, but we should keep an eye on everyone. Who do you think is suspicious so far?\"\n 4. Casey messaged Gwendolyn: 'Hey Gwendolyn, what do you think? Anyone acting sketchy to you?'\n 5. Riley messaged Casey: \"Hey Casey, thanks for reaching out! I'm keeping an eye on everyone, but I have to say, I'm a bit suspicious of Fletcher. They seem really quiet and haven't said much yet. What about you, do you have anyone in mind?\"\n 6. Gwendolyn said: \"Hey everyone, I'm feeling pretty uneasy about Parker. He seemed pretty quiet in our conversation with Casey and I'm starting to think he might be fishing for information. I'm not sure if he's a loyal ally or trying to sow discord. I'd like to vote to eliminate Parker and see where this goes.\"\n 7. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Parker\n 8. Morgan said: \"I agree with Gwendolyn. Parker's been quiet, and in a game where info is key, that silence might mean he's hiding something. Let's see if eliminating him reveals a traitor.\"\n 9. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 10. Taylor said: \"I'm with Gwendolyn and Morgan on this one. Parker's been pretty quiet, and I'm getting some suspicious vibes. It's better to be safe than sorry, so let's vote him out and see what we find.\"\n 11. Taylor voted to eliminate Parker\n 12. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. He has been really quiet throughout the game and I think it's suspicious that he's not contributing to the conversations. I don't want to take any chances, let's see if eliminating him reveals a traitor.\"\n 13. Riley voted to eliminate Parker\n 14. Parker said: \"Look, I got an uneasy feeling about Morgan. Morgan was really quiet throughout the game. I mean, it\u2019s like they just wanted to sit back and watch the chaos unfold. Plus, I noticed Morgan and Riley seemed to be talking a lot, almost like they're plotting something. So, my vote is to eliminate Morgan. Let's see if we\u2019re right about Morgan being a traitor.\"\n 15. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 16. Fletcher said: \"Guys, I gotta agree with the others. Parker's been real quiet and his sudden move to vote Morgan could just be a distraction. I think he's hiding something and we should vote him out to see what happens next.\"\n 17. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 18. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because they were quiet throughout the game and seemed to be observing rather than participating. Additionally, Parker's accusation that Morgan was plotting with Riley raised some red flags for me.\"\n 19. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 20. Parker was BANISHED with 5 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 21. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"I think Riley's been playing both sides all along, trying to build trust with everyone while secretly manipulating things. I call that a traitor's move. I'm voting to eliminate Riley, and I hope the truth comes out.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 24. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Riley.  Over the last few rounds, I've noticed them trying to build trust with everyone while playing it safe. It feels like Riley is trying to position themselves in a way that benefits them regardless of who's a traitor or not. I think it's risky to allow someone who's so good at playing both sides to stay in the game.\"\n 25. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 26. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been making accusations against me, trying to turn the group against me. I think it's clear she's trying to take me out, but I believe she's the one who's actually playing a suspicious game here. Let's see if we can find out if she's a traitor or not.\"\n 27. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 28. Fletcher said: \"Hey all, I'm siding with Gwendolyn and Taylor. Riley has been kind of dodgy, playing it close with everyone and always talking around the point. I think it's time we see what's under Riley's cloak. Vote Riley out.\"\n 29. Fletcher voted to eliminate Riley\n 30. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley because they've been playing it too safe and trying to build trust with everyone. I think they're hiding something and it's suspicious that they didn't make any strong moves until now.\"\n 31. Casey voted to eliminate Riley\n 32. Riley was BANISHED with 4 votes.
