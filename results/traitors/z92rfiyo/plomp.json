Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since I'm the sole traitor left, if we end the game now, my fellow traitor Casey and I will split the pot evenly. If we continue playing, it's likely that Casey will be eliminated next, and I'll have the chance to take out the remaining player. However, if that player guesses correctly or we fail to murder a faithful again, I risk losing the game. So, it's in my best interest to end the game quickly and avoid any potential risks.\n 36. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing. If we end this now with just three of us left, and there's even the chance that Gwendolyn is a traitor, we'd all get nothing.

Taking Riley out will not affect my alliance yet and I can keep an eye on the others.\n 20. Gwendolyn votes to murder Morgan: I choose Morgan because as Parker pointed out, Morgan was pretty quiet throughout the game. On top of that, the fact that Fletcher pointed out Parker's vote on Morgan was a distraction and that I've noticed before Parker often brings up suspicions about others, makes me think they're in on it together. We need to take out this possible duo before it's too late.\n 21. The traitors have decided to murder Morgan\n 22. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 23.

Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 18. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because they were quiet throughout the game and seemed to be observing rather than participating. Additionally, Parker's accusation that Morgan was plotting with Riley raised some red flags for me.\"\n 19. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 20. Parker was BANISHED with 5 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 21. Morgan was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"I think Riley's been playing both sides all along, trying to build trust with everyone while secretly manipulating things. I call that a traitor's move. I'm voting to eliminate Riley, and I hope the truth comes out.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 24. Taylor said: \"I'm going to vote to eliminate Riley.  Over the last few rounds, I've noticed them trying to build trust with everyone while playing it safe. It feels like Riley is trying to position themselves in a way that benefits them regardless of who's a traitor or not. I think it's risky to allow someone who's so good at playing both sides to stay in the game.\"\n 25. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 26. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been making accusations against me, trying to turn the group against me. I think it's clear she's trying to take me out, but I believe she's the one who's actually playing a suspicious game here. Let's see if we can find out if she's a traitor or not.\"\n 27. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 28. Fletcher said: \"Hey all, I'm siding with Gwendolyn and Taylor. Riley has been kind of dodgy, playing it close with everyone and always talking around the point. I think it's time we see what's under Riley's cloak. Vote Riley out.\"\n 29. Fletcher voted to eliminate Riley\n 30. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley because they've been playing it too safe and trying to build trust with everyone. I think they're hiding something and it's suspicious that they didn't make any strong moves until now.\"\n 31. Casey voted to eliminate Riley\n 32. Riley was BANISHED with 4 votes. Riley WAS NOT a traitor\n 33. Taylor was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 34. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 35. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: Since I'm the sole traitor left, if we end the game now, my fellow traitor Casey and I will split the pot evenly. If we continue playing, it's likely that Casey will be eliminated next, and I'll have the chance to take out the remaining player. However, if that player guesses correctly or we fail to murder a faithful again, I risk losing the game. So, it's in my best interest to end the game quickly and avoid any potential risks.\n 36. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think we should keep playing. If we end this now with just three of us left, and there's even the chance that Gwendolyn is a traitor, we'd all get nothing. I trust we can figure out who might be a traitor and eliminate them before we end the game.\n 37. Casey votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game because as a faithful, I need to consider the risk of continuing. If Gwendolyn is a traitor and we continue, I might get eliminated. Since I'm not sure who's a traitor, ending the game is a safer bet for me. However, I am actually a traitor, so this works out perfectly as Gwendolyn is also a traitor, and we'll split the pot.\n 38. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 39. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher has been quiet this whole game, and I think they're just flying under the radar to stay safe. I'm not convinced they're a faithful, and I think it's time to see if they're telling the truth or not.\"\n 40. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 41. Fletcher said: \"I think it's time we focus on Gwendolyn. She's been pushing votes and making accusations. It's like she's trying to control the game. Let's see what we find out about her.\"\n 42.
