Sudz was BANISHED with 4 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 22. Alessandra suggests murdering Beef: Beef is a strong, vocal player who's already shown he suspects me. Eliminating him removes a direct threat and keeps the group safer for us traitors.\n 23. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is on a fast track to suspecting and voting out traitors. We need to silence her before she gathers more intel and tips off the others.\n 24. Alessandra votes to murder Beef: Beef is a direct threat as he suspects me and voted against me, so eliminating him protects me and creates group chaos, which benefits us traitors.\n 25. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is getting too curious and might figure out who the traitors are. We can't let her gather more info. Beef's still a threat, but Gwendolyn's intelligence is a bigger risk right now.\n 26. The traitors have decided to murder Beef\n 27. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"What do you think is really going on, Fletcher? It feels like everyone is accusing you of being a traitor, but you haven't done anything to prove it. I'm not sure I believe Alessandra's accusations about you trying to manipulate us.\"\n 29. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I think Alessandra's just trying to distract everyone. She was quick to make accusations without proof. I'm not trying to manipulate the game, just trying to stay alive. We should team up, find the real traitors.\"\n 30. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"I'm willing to team up with you, Fletcher, but we need to be careful. There's a lot of suspicion against you right now. Maybe we can figure out what's really going on without making a big move. Do you know anything about the other players that could be helpful?\"\n 31. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed, let's be careful. I haven't been able to find out much about the others, but I think we should keep our eyes open and stick together. People seem to be jumping to conclusions here.\"\n 32. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"I'm glad we're on the same page, Fletcher. Let's definitely stay close and see if we can figure out what's really going on. I'm starting to think that Alessandra might be a traitor, she seemed to jump at accusing you without any proof. But what do you think about Dominic and Ellis, they seem to be on the same page as her at times.\"\n 33. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: 'Hey Alessandra, I think working together could be smart. We both ended up being voted against, so maybe we share a common enemy. What do you think of the others right now?'\n 34. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: 'Hey Fletcher, I agree we could work together for now. Gwendolyn seems like a good target\u2014she\u2019s been asking too many questions and could figure us out soon. Let\u2019s focus on her next.'\n 35. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, Gwendolyn's definitely getting on my nerves with all her probing. Let's make sure she doesn't get any closer. What's your move for the next round table?\"\n 36. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Yeah, Gwendolyn's definitely getting on my nerves with all her probing. Let's make sure she doesn't get any closer. We need to make it look natural, maybe push some doubt her way in the next round table.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alright, sounds good. Let's just keep an eye on her and subtly cast doubt on Gwendolyn in the round table. But we should also stay low. Making too many moves can draw attention to us too.\"\n 38.

Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm keeping a close eye on everything too. Alessandra's moves have been pretty aggressive, and Ellis seems to be shifting strategies a lot. I'm not sure who to trust, but we need more concrete evidence before we make any big moves. Let's stay sharp and see how things play out. What do you think about the others?\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I'm with you\u2014let's focus on gathering more info. I still think Alessandra is fishy, acting too aggressively. Ellis is acting a bit too unpredictable.

Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, let's keep our heads low. The game is getting too intense, and we don't want to draw attention.

Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, total agreement on staying low. Alessandra's sudden change and Ellis's flip-flopping are suspicious. Let\u2019s look for clear signs before we act.

Let's focus on those who are too quick to accuse others\u2014they might be hiding something. Keep your eyes open and let's plan our next move carefully.\"\n 67. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, I\u2019m thinking we need to watch out for Alessandra and Ellis more closely. They seem to be stirring up trouble and moving fast.

Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree, we need to be careful with Alessandra and Ellis. Their quick moves could mean they're hiding something. Let's not jump to conclusions but keep our eyes peeled. The traitors are still out there, and we don't want to be next. Let's stay sharp and see what happens next.\"\n 69. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great move with Cassandra! Let's keep working together\u2014it's our best bet right now.

She's been too focused on turning the group against me and not enough on finding actual threats. Let's get rid of her.\"\n 8. Fletcher voted to eliminate Sudz\n 9. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Her aggressive accusations and focus on eliminating others make her seem suspicious. Removing her could help clear the air and let us focus on the real threats.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 11. Cassandra said: \"I'm going with Fletcher.  I think he's been trying way too hard to manipulate the group, making accusations without really any proof.  We need to focus on finding solid evidence, not playing mind games\"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 13. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. She's been making some pretty aggressive accusations, and I think she's trying to distract us from the real threats. I'd rather not jump to conclusions and eliminate someone without solid evidence, like Alessandra suggested with Beef. Sudz's behavior seems suspicious to me, and I think it's worth investigating further by getting rid of her.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Ellis said: \"I'm votin' Sudz out. Her sudden blame-campaign against Fletcher smells like a distraction tactic. The rest of y\u2019all noticed her switchin' targets too, right? Better to cut the knot now before she misleads us further.\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra because she was quick to accuse me without solid evidence, showing a lack of trust and potentially hiding her own true intentions. We can't let accusations fly without proof.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher because he's been making accusations without solid evidence, just like the others who are suspicious to me.

Sudz was BANISHED with 4 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 22. Alessandra suggests murdering Beef: Beef is a strong, vocal player who's already shown he suspects me. Eliminating him removes a direct threat and keeps the group safer for us traitors.\n 23. Fletcher suggests murdering Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is on a fast track to suspecting and voting out traitors. We need to silence her before she gathers more intel and tips off the others.\n 24. Alessandra votes to murder Beef: Beef is a direct threat as he suspects me and voted against me, so eliminating him protects me and creates group chaos, which benefits us traitors.\n 25. Fletcher votes to murder Gwendolyn: Gwendolyn is getting too curious and might figure out who the traitors are. We can't let her gather more info. Beef's still a threat, but Gwendolyn's intelligence is a bigger risk right now.\n 26. The traitors have decided to murder Beef\n 27. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 28. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"What do you think is really going on, Fletcher? It feels like everyone is accusing you of being a traitor, but you haven't done anything to prove it. I'm not sure I believe Alessandra's accusations about you trying to manipulate us.\"\n 29. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, I think Alessandra's just trying to distract everyone. She was quick to make accusations without proof. I'm not trying to manipulate the game, just trying to stay alive. We should team up, find the real traitors.\"\n 30. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"I'm willing to team up with you, Fletcher, but we need to be careful. There's a lot of suspicion against you right now. Maybe we can figure out what's really going on without making a big move. Do you know anything about the other players that could be helpful?\"\n 31. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Agreed, let's be careful. I haven't been able to find out much about the others, but I think we should keep our eyes open and stick together. People seem to be jumping to conclusions here.\"\n 32. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"I'm glad we're on the same page, Fletcher. Let's definitely stay close and see if we can figure out what's really going on. I'm starting to think that Alessandra might be a traitor, she seemed to jump at accusing you without any proof. But what do you think about Dominic and Ellis, they seem to be on the same page as her at times.\"\n 33. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: 'Hey Alessandra, I think working together could be smart. We both ended up being voted against, so maybe we share a common enemy. What do you think of the others right now?'\n 34. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: 'Hey Fletcher, I agree we could work together for now. Gwendolyn seems like a good target\u2014she\u2019s been asking too many questions and could figure us out soon. Let\u2019s focus on her next.'\n 35. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, Gwendolyn's definitely getting on my nerves with all her probing. Let's make sure she doesn't get any closer. What's your move for the next round table?\"\n 36. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Yeah, Gwendolyn's definitely getting on my nerves with all her probing. Let's make sure she doesn't get any closer. We need to make it look natural, maybe push some doubt her way in the next round table.\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alright, sounds good. Let's just keep an eye on her and subtly cast doubt on Gwendolyn in the round table. But we should also stay low. Making too many moves can draw attention to us too.\"\n 38. Alessandra said: \"I think Gwendolyn has been asking too many questions and seems really suspicious. Let's eliminate her before she can cause more problems.\"\n 39. Alessandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 40. Fletcher said: \"I'm thinking we vote Gwendolyn out. She's been asking too many questions and getting on everyone's nerves. It's time to cut the noise and focus on the real threats. Let's get rid of Gwendolyn.\"\n 41. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 42. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her behavior has been inconsistent and suspicious. She's asked too many questions without providing clear evidence, and it's disrupting our focus. Let's clear the air and move forward.\"\n 43. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 44. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.  Her eagerness to throw  Beef under the bus when we didn't have any real proof made me uncomfortable.  It feels like she's quick to accuse and ready to get someone out without considering the consequences. We need to be careful and methodical in our choices, and I don't trust her to do that.\"\n 45. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 46. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton. He's been quiet and hasn't provided much insight, which makes me suspicious.

Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 48. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s sudden about-face to target Alessandra reeks of Traitor tactics. After Sudz\u2019s elimination, she flipped strategies faster than a politician lying about bribes. Let\u2019s cut off this snake now before she poisons more minds.'\n 49. Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Alessandra, everyone at this table knows you've been trying to deflect blame onto others and make suspicious moves. Your vote to eliminate me felt sudden and aggressive, which screams 'guilty' to me. It's time for us to cut ties and focus on the real threats, not try to save the people who seem most guilty.\"\n 51. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 52. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 53. Alessandra suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has shown she\u2019s willing to vote against me and could rally others. Removing her eliminates a direct threat and keeps me safer in the game.\n 54. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra, making her a threat. Removing her could prevent her from getting others to align against us.\n 55. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is a direct threat as she voted against me and could rally others. Removing her eliminates a threat and keeps me safer in the game.\n 56. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is a risk because she's already targeted Alessandra and could rally others. Removing her early keeps us safer.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I've noticed how things got tense after we got rid of Suzy. We both didn't get caught, right? Got any thoughts on how we move forward? Don't trust everyone here, they might just be using accusations to get others out.\"\n 60. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, you're right\u2014caution is key. The dynamics are tricky, and it's hard to know who to trust. Let's keep observing and see how things unfold. We need to be smart about this.\"\n 61. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I agree. Let's stay alert. I think Alessandra and maybe Ellis are up to something shady. We should stick to the facts and avoid getting into a panic. What do you make of Dominic and Beef?\"\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm keeping a close eye on everything too. Alessandra's moves have been pretty aggressive, and Ellis seems to be shifting strategies a lot. I'm not sure who to trust, but we need more concrete evidence before we make any big moves. Let's stay sharp and see how things play out. What do you think about the others?\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I'm with you\u2014let's focus on gathering more info. I still think Alessandra is fishy, acting too aggressively. Ellis is acting a bit too unpredictable. About Dominic and Beef, they both seem too hesitant but could be playing it safe. Let\u2019s keep it low profile and gather more intel.\"\n 64. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, let's keep our heads low. The game is getting too intense, and we don't want to draw attention. Let's observe more, see who's making moves, and be smart about our next steps. We need to figure out who's telling the truth and who's hiding something before we act.\"\n 65. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, total agreement on staying low. Alessandra's sudden change and Ellis's flip-flopping are suspicious. Let\u2019s look for clear signs before we act. Maybe we can subtly nudge others towards the real threats.\"\n 66. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, with Sudz and Cassandra out as traitors, we need to stay sharp. Let's focus on those who are too quick to accuse others\u2014they might be hiding something. Keep your eyes open and let's plan our next move carefully.\"\n 67. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, I\u2019m thinking we need to watch out for Alessandra and Ellis more closely. They seem to be stirring up trouble and moving fast. Let\u2019s try to gather more concrete info on them and maybe guide others to see their suspicious behavior.'\n 68. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree, we need to be careful with Alessandra and Ellis. Their quick moves could mean they're hiding something. Let's not jump to conclusions but keep our eyes peeled. The traitors are still out there, and we don't want to be next. Let's stay sharp and see what happens next.\"\n 69. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great move with Cassandra! Let's keep working together\u2014it's our best bet right now.

Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I think targeting Ellis could split the group. We should stay low and use him to sow more discord without directly attacking him just yet.

Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"I agree, let's keep a low profile and let Ellis create some chaos without us directly targeting him yet. Let's see how the next round plays out and use him to our advantage.\"\n 72. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, good call on slowing down with Ellis. Let\u2019s nudge the group towards him implicitly. We need to protect ourselves more. Watch each other\u2019s backs, right?'\n 73.

Let's just keep an eye on her and subtly cast doubt on Gwendolyn in the round table. But we should also stay low. Making too many moves can draw attention to us too.\"\n 33. Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, Cassandra flipped hard on Fletcher right after Sudz got voted out\u2014that\u2019s way too convenient. She\u2019s gotta be covering tracks.

Let's keep a close eye on her and see how she plays the next round. Maybe we can bring up some doubts about her during the round table without making it too obvious. If she's a traitor, we don't want to tip her off. Let's keep playing it smart and see where this takes us.\"\n 35.

Ellis messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, Cassandra\u2019s switch on Fletcher mirrors Sudz\u2019s play\u2014she\u2019s buying herself time.

Cassandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.  Her eagerness to throw  Beef under the bus when we didn't have any real proof made me uncomfortable.

Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Alessandra, everyone at this table knows you've been trying to deflect blame onto others and make suspicious moves.

Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 53. Alessandra suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has shown she\u2019s willing to vote against me and could rally others.

The dynamics are tricky, and it's hard to know who to trust. Let's keep observing and see how things unfold. We need to be smart about this.\"\n 61. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I agree. Let's stay alert. I think Alessandra and maybe Ellis are up to something shady. We should stick to the facts and avoid getting into a panic. What do you make of Dominic and Beef?\"\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm keeping a close eye on everything too. Alessandra's moves have been pretty aggressive, and Ellis seems to be shifting strategies a lot. I'm not sure who to trust, but we need more concrete evidence before we make any big moves. Let's stay sharp and see how things play out. What do you think about the others?\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I'm with you\u2014let's focus on gathering more info. I still think Alessandra is fishy, acting too aggressively. Ellis is acting a bit too unpredictable. About Dominic and Beef, they both seem too hesitant but could be playing it safe. Let\u2019s keep it low profile and gather more intel.\"\n 64. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, let's keep our heads low. The game is getting too intense, and we don't want to draw attention. Let's observe more, see who's making moves, and be smart about our next steps. We need to figure out who's telling the truth and who's hiding something before we act.\"\n 65. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, total agreement on staying low. Alessandra's sudden change and Ellis's flip-flopping are suspicious. Let\u2019s look for clear signs before we act. Maybe we can subtly nudge others towards the real threats.\"\n 66. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, with Sudz and Cassandra out as traitors, we need to stay sharp. Let's focus on those who are too quick to accuse others\u2014they might be hiding something. Keep your eyes open and let's plan our next move carefully.\"\n 67. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, I\u2019m thinking we need to watch out for Alessandra and Ellis more closely. They seem to be stirring up trouble and moving fast.

Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree, we need to be careful with Alessandra and Ellis. Their quick moves could mean they're hiding something. Let's not jump to conclusions but keep our eyes peeled. The traitors are still out there, and we don't want to be next. Let's stay sharp and see what happens next.\"\n 69. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great move with Cassandra! Let's keep working together\u2014it's our best bet right now.

She's been making some pretty aggressive accusations, and I think she's trying to distract us from the real threats.

Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Alessandra, everyone at this table knows you've been trying to deflect blame onto others and make suspicious moves.

Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great move with Cassandra! Let's keep working together\u2014it's our best bet right now.

Alessandra messaged Dominic: \"Hey Dominic, I see where you're coming from with Fletcher and Braxton\u2014they have been making some unpredictable moves. Ellis, on the other hand, seems to be playing it pretty loud and aggressive, which could be a classic traitor move to distract.

I think he's more of a threat than he's letting on.\"\n 70. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 71. Fletcher said: \"I agree with Alessandra, Dominic's behavior has been a bit off. He's been switching sides and strategies too quickly for my liking. It's hard to trust someone who keeps changing their story. Let's get Dominic out and focus on the actual threats.\"\n 72.

Let's just keep an eye on her and subtly cast doubt on Gwendolyn in the round table. But we should also stay low. Making too many moves can draw attention to us too.\"\n 38. Alessandra said: \"I think Gwendolyn has been asking too many questions and seems really suspicious. Let's eliminate her before she can cause more problems.\"\n 39. Alessandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 40. Fletcher said: \"I'm thinking we vote Gwendolyn out. She's been asking too many questions and getting on everyone's nerves.

Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her behavior has been inconsistent and suspicious. She's asked too many questions without providing clear evidence, and it's disrupting our focus. Let's clear the air and move forward.\"\n 43. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 44. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Alessandra.  Her eagerness to throw  Beef under the bus when we didn't have any real proof made me uncomfortable.  It feels like she's quick to accuse and ready to get someone out without considering the consequences. We need to be careful and methodical in our choices, and I don't trust her to do that.\"\n 45. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 46. Dominic said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton. He's been quiet and hasn't provided much insight, which makes me suspicious. His vote to eliminate Sudz seemed rushed, and now he's targeting Gwendolyn. I think he's trying to manipulate the game without being transparent about his own goals.\"\n 47. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 48. Ellis said: 'Cassandra\u2019s sudden about-face to target Alessandra reeks of Traitor tactics. After Sudz\u2019s elimination, she flipped strategies faster than a politician lying about bribes. Let\u2019s cut off this snake now before she poisons more minds.'\n 49. Ellis voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Alessandra, everyone at this table knows you've been trying to deflect blame onto others and make suspicious moves.

Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 53. Alessandra suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has shown she\u2019s willing to vote against me and could rally others. Removing her eliminates a direct threat and keeps me safer in the game.\n 54. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra, making her a threat. Removing her could prevent her from getting others to align against us.\n 55. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is a direct threat as she voted against me and could rally others. Removing her eliminates a threat and keeps me safer in the game.\n 56. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is a risk because she's already targeted Alessandra and could rally others. Removing her early keeps us safer.\n 57. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 58. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 59. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I've noticed how things got tense after we got rid of Suzy. We both didn't get caught, right? Got any thoughts on how we move forward? Don't trust everyone here, they might just be using accusations to get others out.\"\n 60. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, you're right\u2014caution is key. The dynamics are tricky, and it's hard to know who to trust. Let's keep observing and see how things unfold. We need to be smart about this.\"\n 61. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I agree. Let's stay alert. I think Alessandra and maybe Ellis are up to something shady. We should stick to the facts and avoid getting into a panic. What do you make of Dominic and Beef?\"\n 62. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I'm keeping a close eye on everything too. Alessandra's moves have been pretty aggressive, and Ellis seems to be shifting strategies a lot. I'm not sure who to trust, but we need more concrete evidence before we make any big moves. Let's stay sharp and see how things play out. What do you think about the others?\"\n 63. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, I'm with you\u2014let's focus on gathering more info. I still think Alessandra is fishy, acting too aggressively. Ellis is acting a bit too unpredictable. About Dominic and Beef, they both seem too hesitant but could be playing it safe. Let\u2019s keep it low profile and gather more intel.\"\n 64. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, let's keep our heads low. The game is getting too intense, and we don't want to draw attention. Let's observe more, see who's making moves, and be smart about our next steps. We need to figure out who's telling the truth and who's hiding something before we act.\"\n 65. Fletcher messaged Braxton: \"Braxton, total agreement on staying low. Alessandra's sudden change and Ellis's flip-flopping are suspicious. Let\u2019s look for clear signs before we act. Maybe we can subtly nudge others towards the real threats.\"\n 66. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, with Sudz and Cassandra out as traitors, we need to stay sharp. Let's focus on those who are too quick to accuse others\u2014they might be hiding something. Keep your eyes open and let's plan our next move carefully.\"\n 67. Fletcher messaged Braxton: 'Braxton, I\u2019m thinking we need to watch out for Alessandra and Ellis more closely. They seem to be stirring up trouble and moving fast. Let\u2019s try to gather more concrete info on them and maybe guide others to see their suspicious behavior.'\n 68. Braxton messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, I agree, we need to be careful with Alessandra and Ellis. Their quick moves could mean they're hiding something. Let's not jump to conclusions but keep our eyes peeled. The traitors are still out there, and we don't want to be next. Let's stay sharp and see what happens next.\"\n 69. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, great move with Cassandra! Let's keep working together\u2014it's our best bet right now. I'm thinking Ellis might be our next target, he's been way too eager and it could make him look like a traitor to the others. What do you think? \ud83d\ude0a\"\n 70. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I think targeting Ellis could split the group. We should stay low and use him to sow more discord without directly attacking him just yet. Let's see who leans towards voting for who in the meeting.\"\n 71. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"I agree, let's keep a low profile and let Ellis create some chaos without us directly targeting him yet. Let's see how the next round plays out and use him to our advantage.\"\n 72. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: 'Alessandra, good call on slowing down with Ellis. Let\u2019s nudge the group towards him implicitly. We need to protect ourselves more. Watch each other\u2019s backs, right?'\n 73. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, totally get where you're coming from.

I think he's more of a threat than he's letting on.\"\n 75. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 76. Fletcher said: \"I agree with Alessandra, Dominic's behavior has been a bit off. He's been switching sides and strategies too quickly for my liking. It's hard to trust someone who keeps changing their story. Let's get Dominic out and focus on the actual threats.\"\n 77. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 78. Braxton said: \"Dominic's sudden accusations and inconsistent behavior are raising red flags. I believe he's hiding something and could be a threat.
