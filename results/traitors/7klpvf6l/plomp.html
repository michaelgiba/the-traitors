That goes against their earlier behavior where they seemed more careful.  To me, that suggests someone trying to manipulate the narrative and possibly trying to cover their own tracks.\"\n 24. Taylor voted to eliminate Morgan\n 25. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan. They've been acting suspiciously agreeable and quick to jump on the bandwagon with accusations. Their behavior has raised some red flags for me and others, and I think it's best to err on the side of caution and get them out before they can cause more harm.\"\n 26. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 27. Parker said: \"Morgan's been acting too agreeable and quick to jump on the bandwagon with accusations. Their behavior has raised some red flags for me and others, and I think it's best to err on the side of caution and get them out before they can cause more harm.\"\n 28. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 29. Morgan was BANISHED with 4 votes. Morgan WAS NOT a traitor\n 30. Taylor was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 31. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 32. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: We should eliminate another player to ensure the traitors have a better chance of winning. If we end the game now, there's a risk that the remaining faithful will split the pot if they figure out I'm a traitor. By continuing, I can potentially eliminate another faithful and increase the traitors' chances of winning.\n 33. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. With only three players left, I think it's better to end it now and ensure I get a share of the pot. Casey seems suspicious, and if they're a traitor, ending the game now would prevent them from getting everything. I've been trying to gather information, but I'm not sure who the traitors are. Ending the game now is the safest option for me and the other faithful.\n 34. Parker votes to END_GAME: I don't want to risk a chance for any of us to end up with nothing, especially since I can't be certain who the traitors are. It's better to end the game now so that even if I don't get to know all the traitors, I still have a fair chance to split the money. Casey's behavior has been somewhat suspicious to me, but without concrete evidence, it's too risky to end the game. I'm voting to end the game for the sake of fairness and to minimize the risk of ending up with nothing.\n 35. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 36. Casey said: \"Riley's been asking too many questions, I think they're getting close to figuring out the truth. We need to eliminate them to protect our chances.\"\n 37. Casey voted to eliminate Riley\n 38. Riley said: \"Casey's been making big moves and trying to eliminate people left and right. I'm not convinced they're not a traitor. I think we should eliminate Casey to ensure the faithful have a chance to win.\"\n 39.
