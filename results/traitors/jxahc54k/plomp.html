I think it's best if we eliminate them and see where that takes us.\"\n 8. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 9. Cassandra said: \"Yeah, I gotta agree with Alessandra here.

Braxton said: \"I agree with Alessandra and Cassandra. Sudz hasn't been contributing much and their behavior is suspicious. Let's eliminate them to see if they were a traitor or not.\"\n 12.

Sudz said: \"Guys, I've noticed Braxton hasn't been much help in our discussions. It's like they're holding back, and it's been making me a bit suspicious.

Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 30. Cassandra said: \"I'm starting to get a iffy feeling about Dominic.  He's been a bit too quiet lately and seems hesitant to jump into the conversation.

Dominic said: \"Guys, I think we need to look at who's been pushing the hardest to eliminate people. Alessandra and Cassandra, your sudden concerns about me feel a bit convenient. Braxton, you've been steering the conversation and vote multiple times, it's making me suspicious. I think Braxton is the one we should be looking at here.\"\n 35. Dominic voted to eliminate Braxton\n 36. Ellis said: \"Braxton's eagerness to join the anti-Sudz mob and his sudden alliance with Alessandra feels forced.

With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 46.

Continuing risks further eliminations which might target us. Let's lock in our positions and the prize.\n 47. Cassandra votes to END_GAME: With only three players left, the risk of betrayal is high. Ending the game now maximizes our chances of winning, as any remaining faithful players are unlikely to uncover our identities.\n 48. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYINGING: Ending now is a trap. Let's eliminate either Alessandra or Cassandra first\u2014they\u2019ve pushed eliminations too aggressively. Trusting their sudden rush to END feels risky when they've both been playing aggressively to control eliminations. Testing their loyalty by votingin someone out first gives us stronger evidence before finalizing.\n 49. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 50. Alessandra said: \"I think we should eliminate Ellis. Ellis has been cautious and quiet, and their hesitation to end the game makes me suspicious.
