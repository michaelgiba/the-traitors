With only three players remaining, it is now a higher risk to continue playing without knowing the identity of the last remaining traitor. Ending the game ensures that the remaining faithful can claim any remaining funds if all traitors have been eliminated, or that the traitors can split everything if any traitors remain. Given the high stakes and the need to make a cautious choice in this final stage, Sudz would vote to END_GAME to avoid the risk of losing everything if a traitor is still among the remaining players.\n 37.

Sudz messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, no hard feelings for sure. Let's work together to root out the traitors. Let's discuss as much as we need to in these private talks. I'll also think about what you mentioned regarding focusing on voting out the traitors first. Let's make sure we stick together and keep it strategic as we move forward. The final rounds will require our full cooperation. Let's stay in tune with the group.\"\n 5. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Beef, seems like he's been pretty quiet and I don't know much about him, think it's time to get some info out\"\n 6. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 7. Sudz said: \"Hey, I think Braxton has been acting a bit off. He doesn't really seem to be contributing much to our discussions and he hasn't shown any genuine concern for others. I think it's time we got rid of him.\"\n 8. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 9. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting Braxton because he's been really quiet and hasn't contributed much. I think we need to see if he's hiding something.\"\n 10. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 11. Braxton said: \"Alright, everyone. I think Sudz might be a bit too eager to point fingers here. I'm voting Sudz out. There's something about his accusations that doesn't sit right with me.\"\n 12. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 13. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting Braxton out. He's been pretty quiet and hasn't really opened up to us.  Plus,  his last-minute attack on Sudz feels like a desperate attempt to throw us off.\"\n 14. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 15. Ellis said: \"I'm voting Braxton. His sudden attack on Sudz feels defensive, and he\u2019s been unusually quiet in key moments. Let\u2019s remove someone who\u2019s not contributing to our strategy. If he\u2019s innocent, we\u2019ll regroup. If not... better safe than sorry. Let\u2019s prioritize unity to catch whoever\u2019s working against us.\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Dominic because he was the first to point fingers at me, and it felt like a strategic move to eliminate a potential threat. Let's see if he's hiding something.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Dominic\n 19. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS NOT a traitor\n 20. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 21. Sudz messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, Dominic's vote against me for Braxton just made me wonder if he might have an agenda. I'm still keeping my cards close to my chest, but if there's any way we can align our strategies or work together, I'd be open to it. Let's talk more and figure out what our next move should be.\"\n 22. Ellis messaged Sudz: \"You think Dominic's move was shady? Let's keep watching him and anyone else acting off. We need to sync our votes next round to take out the real traitors. Stay sharp\u2014trust but verify.\"\n 23. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Sudz. He's been making some pretty strong accusations, and I think he's trying to distract us from the real traitors. His vote to murder Ellis seemed extreme, and I think he's trying to throw us off his own trail. Let's get rid of him and see what happens.\"\n 24. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 25. Sudz said: \"I voted for Dominic's elimination. Dominic's accusation towards me for Braxton was a red flag, but more so, his quick vote against me for Braxton seems strategic, not defensive. His alignment against Braxton suggests a possible connection. His push for unity seems too calculated and could be a tactic to lower others' guard. While I have been focused and have contributed significantly, I urge us to consider if there's a traitor amongst us manipulating from the shadows. Let's be cautious and thorough.\"\n 26. Sudz voted to eliminate Dominic\n 27. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting out Dominic because he was quick to accuse Beef, and after Beef was murdered, it makes me think Dominic might be hiding something. I believe he could be a traitor trying to eliminate faithful players.\"\n 28. Alessandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 29. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting out Dominic.  His quick accusations early on and his attempt to pin the blame on Sudz  make me really uncomfortable. He seems like he's trying to steer the conversation and manipulate the votes. I think it's time we got rid of someone who might be trying to throw us off our game.\"\n 30. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 31. Ellis said: 'Dominic\u2019s rash accusations and calculated moves smell off. He jumped on Sudz too fast after Braxton\u2019s banishment, and his votes feel manipulative. Let\u2019s cut the noise and vote out the guy actively weaponizing paranoia. Eliminate Dominic.'\n 32. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 33. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS a traitor\n 34. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 35. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 36. Sudz votes to END_GAME: As Sudz, the goal throughout the game was to survive and outlast the others by identifying and eliminating traitors. With only three players remaining, it is now a higher risk to continue playing without knowing the identity of the last remaining traitor. Ending the game ensures that the remaining faithful can claim any remaining funds if all traitors have been eliminated, or that the traitors can split everything if any traitors remain. Given the high stakes and the need to make a cautious choice in this final stage, Sudz would vote to END_GAME to avoid the risk of losing everything if a traitor is still among the remaining players.\n 37. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: I think ending the game is safer because if there's still a traitor among us, continuing could mean they win. I'm unsure if Sudz is a traitor, but ending now might protect us if all traitors are gone.\n 38. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Ending now risks giving money to remaining traitors. We need to eliminate one more to isolate the traitor and ensure we don\u2019t hand them the whole pot.\n 39. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 40. Sudz said: \"I vote to eliminate Ellis. Throughout this game, Ellis has shown an unusual focus on unity and maintaining the peace. While this may seem like a positive trait, it has also served as a strategy to lower our guard against potential traitors. Ellis's quick vote against Braxton after Braxton's banishment, combined with his strong push for unity, has raised my suspicions. I believe he might have a vested interest in keeping others too trusting or too distracted to uncover his true motives. Let\u2019s eliminate Ellis to remove this potential threat and focus our attention on uncovering the remaining traitor.\"\n 41. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 42. Alessandra said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz because his aggressive accusations make me think he might be hiding something. Let's see if he's a traitor.\"\n 43.
