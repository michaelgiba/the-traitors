Parker was BANISHED with 4 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 57. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 58. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't feel confident that all traitors have been eliminated. Continuing allows us to remove another player, which might expose any remaining traitors. I don't want to risk ending the game only to have traitors win. Better safe than sorry\u2014let's make sure we're all faithful before we finish.\n 59. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While it's tempting to end the game and split the prize, we're so close to being sure all the traitors are gone. I don't want to risk splitting the pot evenly between the faithful and traitors if there are still any hiding.  One more elimination could ensure we all go home with the prize! \n 60. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. We've had some close calls and I don't want to risk ending the game with traitors still in the mix. One more round could help us figure out who's trustworthy and ensure we all get a fair share of the prize.\n 61. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I still have my doubts about who the traitors are, especially after how things have played out. Let\u2019s eliminate one more player to make sure we\u2019re all safe before splitting the prize.\n 62. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue.

It's his sudden fear of Morgan and then immediately switching to me.\"\n 60. Fletcher messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I agree, Parker's moves seem calculated. We should be smarter with our moves next. What's your take on Riley? Could be a solid ally.\"\n 61. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker because his actions have raised some red flags.

Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 63. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. While it's been a rollercoaster, I have serious concerns about Parker's gameplay.  From targeting Morgan without solid evidence to quickly shifting his focus to me,  his motives seem unclear and frankly, manipulative. We need to be wary of anyone who's quick to point fingers and sway the group without clear justification.  I think it's best to remove someone who's already shown a tendency for calculated moves, especially when it comes to aligning with others for their own benefit.

Parker said: \"Taylor, I've been closely observing your gameplay throughout this game. I initially had some reservations about your trustworthiness, given your quick judgments and accusations. However, I also have to consider your actions and motives. Taylor's behavior seemed quite defensive and over the top, particularly when targeting Gwendolyn and later expressing concerns about Morgan. These actions suggest that Taylor may have been trying to control the narrative and eliminate perceived threats without solid evidence. I believe that removing Taylor from the game would allow us to work more cohesively and honestly with the remaining faithful players.\"\n 68. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 69.

Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While it's tempting to end the game and split the prize, we're so close to being sure all the traitors are gone. I don't want to risk splitting the pot evenly between the faithful and traitors if there are still any hiding.  One more elimination could ensure we all go home with the prize! \n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. We've had some close calls and I don't want to risk ending the game with traitors still in the mix.

Parker said: \"Hey all, after listening to the heated debates, I see why there's been mistrust surrounding Morgan.

Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 47. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. While I appreciate the opportunity to work with everyone,  some things just don't sit right with me.  Gwendolyn's sudden shift to target Morgan after a period of cooperation feels very calculating. It's as if she's trying to blend in while maneuvering to eliminate a perceived threat.

Taylor messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I've been kind of talking to Casey and Fletcher about who seems a little off.  Anyone you've noticed anything suspicious about?\"\n 4. Riley messaged Taylor: \"I've been keeping an eye on Morgan, they seem really quiet and haven't contributed much to the discussions. What do you think about them?\"\n 5. Taylor messaged Riley: \"I hear you about Morgan. They definitely haven't been as vocal as the rest of us. Let's see if we can get a better read on them. Maybe we can try talking to some other people too and see if they've noticed anything.\"\n 6. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Let's also keep an eye on Parker, they seem pretty friendly with everyone, might be trying to gain trust too easily.\"\n 7. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. She's been suspiciously quiet throughout the game, and I think we should get rid of her before she becomes a problem.\"\n 8. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 9. Morgan said: \"I'm voting against Casey because his move against Gwendolyn feels off. He's targeting someone who's been working with me to figure things out, and his reasons don't add up. I trust Gwendolyn more than Casey's sudden accusations.\"\n 10. Morgan voted to eliminate Casey\n 11. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey.  While I appreciate Morgan's trust in Gwendolyn and me, Casey's sudden jump to eliminate Gwendolyn feels forced. His reasons seemed flimsy, especially given he supposedly hasn't noticed anything else suspicious about her.  I think he's trying to mislead us and stir up drama.  We need to cut out the manipulation and stick to solid evidence.\"\n 12. Taylor voted to eliminate Casey\n 13. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey. His reasons for targeting Gwendolyn seemed really weak and I think he's trying to throw us off. Plus, Morgan and Taylor both made good points about his motives feeling off. Let's not jump to conclusions without solid evidence.\"\n 14. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 15. Parker said: \"Hey all, after listening to the heated debates, I see why there's been mistrust surrounding Morgan. While I don't have concrete evidence against him, his quick dismissal of Casey's accusations and his apparent alliance with Morgan seems to be a calculated move to protect his interests. I also can't ignore the fact that Morgan hasn't shared his reasoning with us, which feels untrustworthy. So, I'm voting to eliminate Morgan.\"\n 16. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 17. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Casey. I agree with Taylor and Riley. Casey\u2019s reasons for voting out Gwendolyn seemed forced and weak. We should be more cautious and remove those who might be causing unnecessary drama and confusion.\"\n 18. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 19. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because he seemed to be pushing a personal agenda with his quick dismissal of Casey's accusations and his alliance with himself. His reasoning felt untrustworthy and it's understandable why Parker has concerns about him.\"\n 20. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 21. Casey was BANISHED with 4 votes. Casey WAS a traitor\n 22. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because her quick turn against me after we worked together seems suspicious. It feels like she might be a traitor trying to eliminate a faithful without making it obvious. I think removing her could help protect the rest of us and keep the group safer.\"\n 23. Morgan voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 24. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. While I appreciate the opportunity to work with everyone,  some things just don't sit right with me.  Gwendolyn's sudden shift to target Morgan after a period of cooperation feels very calculating. It's as if she's trying to blend in while maneuvering to eliminate a perceived threat.  This, coupled with her quiet demeanor throughout the game, makes me uneasy.  Trust is crucial in this game, and I don't feel confident in Gwendolyn at this point.  I believe eliminating her will help us uncover the truth and get closer to the prize.\"\n 25. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 26. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. Her sudden shift in targets and quiet demeanor throughout the game makes me uneasy. I trust Taylor's instincts and think we should get rid of her to uncover the truth.\"\n 27. Riley voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 28. Parker said: \"I'd like to eliminate Gwendolyn. Her sudden opposition towards me was unexpected and her actions seemed very calculated. Her quiet demeanor throughout the game made me suspicious. I can't dismiss it as coincidence. I believe she might be playing against us and we need to protect ourselves.\"\n 29. Parker voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 30. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn. Her sudden shift in alliances and her quiet nature throughout the game have made me really uncomfortable. She's been too passive, and now she's moving against Morgan so quickly. This could be a ploy. We need to remove those who are playing too safe and shifting gears too easily.\"\n 31. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 32. Gwendolyn said: \"Taylor's been really quick to doubt me, and I think he's trying to cause tension in the group. His reactions feel a bit over the top, and I'm starting to think he might be one of the traitors. I'm voting to eliminate him to protect the rest of us and figure out who's really working against us.\"\n 33. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Taylor\n 34. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 5 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 35. Morgan messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, that was a big move getting rid of Gwendolyn. I'm glad we're on the same page, but I'm still a bit uneasy. Do you think Parker or Fletcher might be hiding something? Let me know what you're thinking.\"\n 36. Riley messaged Morgan: \"Morgan, I'm getting a little worried about Parker too. They seem to be playing both sides, but I don't have any concrete evidence. Let's keep an eye on them and see if they make any more suspicious moves. What do you know about Fletcher?\"\n 37. Morgan messaged Riley: \"I share your concerns about Parker, let's keep a close eye on him without being obvious. Fletcher seems less suspicious so far, but let's stay vigilant.\"\n 38. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I've been thinking about our discussion on Morgan's suspicious behavior. I agree with your points, but I'm still not entirely convinced. I think it's crucial we keep an open mind and continue observing their actions closely. Do you have any specific indicators or actions to watch for in Morgan?\"\n 39. Riley messaged Parker: \"Parker, I'm still keeping an eye on Morgan, their quietness is suspicious. But I also want to know, what made you target Gwendolyn so strongly? You seemed really convinced she was the one.\"\n 40. Parker messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I've been thinking about our discussion on Morgan's suspicious behavior. I agree with your points, but I'm still not entirely convinced. I think it's crucial we keep an open mind and continue observing their actions closely. Do you have any specific indicators or actions to watch for in Morgan?\"\n 41. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker because his actions have raised some red flags. He's been targeting me without solid reasons, and others share these concerns. It's a tough call, but we need to protect ourselves from potential threats.\"\n 42. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 43. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. While it's been a rollercoaster, I have serious concerns about Parker's gameplay.  From targeting Morgan without solid evidence to quickly shifting his focus to me,  his motives seem unclear and frankly, manipulative. We need to be wary of anyone who's quick to point fingers and sway the group without clear justification.  I think it's best to remove someone who's already shown a tendency for calculated moves, especially when it comes to aligning with others for their own benefit. I believe eliminating Parker will help get us closer to the truth and ensure we're working with a more trustworthy group.\"\n 44. Taylor voted to eliminate Parker\n 45. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. They've been making moves that seem really calculated and manipulative. From strongly targeting Gwendolyn to quickly turning on Morgan, their actions feel like they're trying to control the narrative and eliminate threats without solid evidence. I trust Taylor and Morgan's instincts, and I think we should get rid of Parker to ensure we're working with genuine people.\"\n 46. Riley voted to eliminate Parker\n 47. Parker said: \"Taylor, I've been closely observing your gameplay throughout this game. I initially had some reservations about your trustworthiness, given your quick judgments and accusations. However, I also have to consider your actions and motives. Taylor's behavior seemed quite defensive and over the top, particularly when targeting Gwendolyn and later expressing concerns about Morgan. These actions suggest that Taylor may have been trying to control the narrative and eliminate perceived threats without solid evidence. I believe that removing Taylor from the game would allow us to work more cohesively and honestly with the remaining faithful players.\"\n 48. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 49. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Parker. His moves have been too calculated and he's jumping on people without solid evidence. He seems to be manipulating the group's decisions more than anyone else. We need to be rid of someone like that if we want to secure this game.\"\n 50. Fletcher voted to eliminate Parker\n 51. Parker was BANISHED with 4 votes. Parker WAS NOT a traitor\n 52. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 53. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't feel confident that all traitors have been eliminated. Continuing allows us to remove another player, which might expose any remaining traitors. I don't want to risk ending the game only to have traitors win. Better safe than sorry\u2014let's make sure we're all faithful before we finish.\n 54. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: While it's tempting to end the game and split the prize, we're so close to being sure all the traitors are gone. I don't want to risk splitting the pot evenly between the faithful and traitors if there are still any hiding.  One more elimination could ensure we all go home with the prize! \n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced that all traitors have been eliminated. We've had some close calls and I don't want to risk ending the game with traitors still in the mix. One more round could help us figure out who's trustworthy and ensure we all get a fair share of the prize.\n 56. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I still have my doubts about who the traitors are, especially after how things have played out. Let\u2019s eliminate one more player to make sure we\u2019re all safe before splitting the prize.\n 57. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 4 to continue. The game will continue.\n 58. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher because he's been really quiet throughout the game. I don't know much about his intentions, and I think he might be a traitor trying to hide. Let's eliminate him to make sure we're all faithful.\"\n 59. Morgan voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 60. Taylor said: \"Fletcher has been very quiet throughout the game, and I personally haven't felt a strong connection to him. We haven't really had deep conversations, and I just haven't gotten a good read on him. Given the high stakes, I need to trust my gut here.  With only three of us left, the risk of a hidden traitor is too high. I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher.\"\n 61. Taylor voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 62. Riley said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher. Throughout this game, Fletcher has been incredibly quiet and hasn't shared much about their thoughts or strategies. Given that we're down to the final few players, I need to consider the risks of a hidden traitor. With Morgan and Taylor, I've had more open discussions and feel like I can trust their intentions. Fletcher's silence is concerning, and I think it's better to err on the side of caution. Let's remove the uncertainty and eliminate Fletcher to ensure we're working with genuine players.\"\n 63. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 64. Fletcher said: \"I think we should eliminate Morgan. Throughout the game, he's been quick to jump to conclusions without much evidence, especially against Gwendolyn and now Taylor and me. His rapid change and the pressure he puts on others raise some red flags for me. Let's remove him to make sure we're all on the same page in the final stretch.\"\n 65. Fletcher voted to eliminate Morgan\n 66. Fletcher was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 67. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 68. Morgan votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I don't feel confident all traitors are gone. Continuing allows us to eliminate another player and ensure any remaining traitors are exposed. Better to be safe and certain before ending the game.\n 69. Taylor votes to END_GAME: We're down to the final three. The risk of someone still being a traitor at this point feels too high. I've seen enough to know someone was lying. Let's split the money!\n 70. Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm voting to end the game. At this point, I trust Taylor and Morgan, and I think we've had enough discussions. The risk of a traitor still being in the mix is always there, but I believe we've done our best to figure out who's who. I'd rather take the chance of splitting the prize with two other players I trust than risk continuing and possibly walking away with nothing if there's still a traitor.\n 71. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 72. Morgan said: \"Taylor, I'm voting to eliminate you because your quick judgments and shifts in the game make me question your loyalty. I think you might be the remaining traitor.\"\n 73. Morgan voted to eliminate Taylor\n 74. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley.  Throughout this game, Riley has been too careful and consistent, almost too comfortable with Morgan.
