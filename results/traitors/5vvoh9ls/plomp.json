Gwendolyn's sudden chill after jumping on Beef is suspicious too. It makes me think she might be protected by one of the traitors, maybe even controlled by them. We need to figure out who's the stronger player in this, who's really calling the shots.  Maybe we push Gwendolyn hard, see if she cracks\"\n 49. Ellis messaged Cassandra: 'Gwen\u2019s backtrack stinks. If she\u2019s under orders to flip, she\u2019ll act weird again.

Time to squeeze them both and see how they react. If they start acting more defensive, they're our targets. If they stay calm, we gotta look elsewhere. We need to dismantle this traitor team.\"\n 51. Ellis messaged Cassandra: 'DOMINick\u2019s loyalty\u2019s sketchy too. If we hit Gwendolyn hard during voting, real Faithfuls\u2019ll back us. Vote her first\u2014see who breaks.'\n 52.

Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, honestly, I did pick up on some red flags with Beef. His quiet nature and being one step ahead seemed suspicious, but it was Alexandras vote that really sealed it for me - I was just parroting what I thought was a consensus. We can't focus on one individual for too long, or we risk missing other traitors. I think Fletcher's been acting odd too. Let's keep gathering evidence and be cautious, we still have no idea who else might be in on it\"\n 44. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Alright, but if Fletcher\u2019s really clean, he\u2019d stick to his story. Let\u2019s see if he or someone else flips when pressure\u2019s on.

I've been following my instincts, but I'm glad we're being cautious. I think Fletcher's been acting too defensive since Sudz got voted out. And yeah, 3 traitors left is a lot to deal with.

Real Faithfuls don\u2019t switch so fast. You triangulate who\u2019s the boss traitor now?'\n 48. Cassandra messaged Ellis: \"You're right, Ellis. Something's definitely off with Fletcher.  Gwendolyn's sudden chill after jumping on Beef is suspicious too. It makes me think she might be protected by one of the traitors, maybe even controlled by them. We need to figure out who's the stronger player in this, who's really calling the shots.  Maybe we push Gwendolyn hard, see if she cracks\"\n 49. Ellis messaged Cassandra: 'Gwen\u2019s backtrack stinks. If she\u2019s under orders to flip, she\u2019ll act weird again. We hit Fletcher and Gwendolyn hard tomorrow\u2014real Faithfuls won\u2019t panic. You copy? Let\u2019s corner \u2018em both.'\n 50. Cassandra messaged Ellis: \"I'm with ya, Ellis.  Time to squeeze them both and see how they react. If they start acting more defensive, they're our targets. If they stay calm, we gotta look elsewhere. We need to dismantle this traitor team.\"\n 51. Ellis messaged Cassandra: 'DOMINick\u2019s loyalty\u2019s sketchy too. If we hit Gwendolyn hard during voting, real Faithfuls\u2019ll back us. Vote her first\u2014see who breaks.'\n 52.

Cassandra said: \"Okay, I've been trying to stay neutral and read everyone, but right now, I'm feeling like Gwendolyn is too closely tied to Fletcher. There's been a lot of shifting from her, going from aggressively pointing at Beef to suddenly calming down.

If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I want to make sure we eliminate all traitors before ending the game. Let's eliminate another player and see what happens.\n 66. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: There's still too much uncertainty. Ending the game now with traitors potentially still around means we all get nothing. Let's take one more person out to clear things up.\n 67. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYINGNG: Ending now would let any remaining traitor steal everything. We need to root out the last bad player before cashing in.

Let's take him out to see if it clears up the game.\"\n 60. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 61. Ellis said: 'Gwendolyn\u2019s backtrack on Beef was shady as hell. Flips her stance harder than a politician. If she was legit, she\u2019d stay steady. Let\u2019s see who scrambles when her mask cracks.'\n 62. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 63. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's been the most aggressive player lately, making big moves and trying to control the narrative. He's always been a bit too confident and has shifted targets multiple times, which doesn't sit well with me. His previous vote to eliminate Cassandra also raised some red flags. I think we need to take him out and see if it makes a difference in the game.\"\n 64. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 65. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 2 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 66. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's rapid shift in her voting target and her constant trying to twist the narrative is making her a target that could disrupt our plans. Taking her out will remove a potential manipulator from the game and add more confusion to the remaining players.\n 67. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's vote flip and narrative manipulation could be a big risk. We got to keep the faithfuls confused and remove a major disruptor like her to keep our game strong.\n 68. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 69. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 70. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 71. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Fletcher is a traitor or not. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I want to make sure we eliminate all traitors before ending the game. Let's eliminate another player and see what happens.\n 72. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: There's still too much uncertainty. Ending the game now with traitors potentially still around means we all get nothing. Let's take one more person out to clear things up.\n 73. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYINGNG: Ending now would let any remaining traitor steal everything. We need to root out the last bad player before cashing in. Fletcher\u2019s inconsistency and Gwendolyn\u2019s suspicious flip earlier make me think we\u2019re still sitting on a traitor. Better to take one more swing and weed them out.\n 74. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 75. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been playing both sides and making big moves without solid proof. His actions scream 'traitor' to me. Let's eliminate him to be safe.\"\n 76. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 77. Ellis said: 'Fletcher\u2019s inconsistency is a ticking bomb. He\u2019s been shifting alliances faster than a traitor in a storm. Let\u2019s end this now before they torch the whole game. Eliminate Fletcher!'\n 78.
