He seems to be always just a step ahead, and while he says he's just trying to guide us, something feels off.  We gotta cut the potential danger early on, and right now, that feels like Beef.\"\n 15. Cassandra voted to eliminate Beef\n 16. Dominic said: \"I've been observing Sudz's behavior, and it seems really suspicious.

Gwendolyn said: \"I think it's time for us to make a smart move. We've had many players pointing out suspicious behavior and manipulative tactics from some individuals.

Do you think there might be more to him than meets the eye?\"\n 27. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: 'Yeah, I had my suspicions about Beef too. But since he was murdered, he was probably a faithful. Now we need to focus on figuring out who the remaining traitors are. What do you think about the others?'\n 28. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"Completely agree, I've seen a lot of players pointing out Braxton's suspicious behavior.

Gwendolyn said: \"I think Fletcher might be more involved in this game than we think. Everyone's been pointing out his eagerness to eliminate Beef and now Braxton.

Braxton was BANISHED with 3 votes. Braxton WAS a traitor\n 44. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 45. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Gwen, Beef survived but Alessandra\u2019s dead\u2014too clean. Why did you lean on Beef so fast? Let\u2019s verify if you saw something legit, or if you\u2019re covering Fletcher\u2019s back?'\n 46. Gwendolyn messaged Ellis: \"Ellis, honestly, I did pick up on some red flags with Beef. His quiet nature and being one step ahead seemed suspicious, but it was Alexandras vote that really sealed it for me - I was just parroting what I thought was a consensus. We can't focus on one individual for too long, or we risk missing other traitors. I think Fletcher's been acting odd too. Let's keep gathering evidence and be cautious, we still have no idea who else might be in on it\"\n 47. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'Alright, but if Fletcher\u2019s really clean, he\u2019d stick to his story. Let\u2019s see if he or someone else flips when pressure\u2019s on.

I've been following my instincts, but I'm glad we're being cautious. I think Fletcher's been acting too defensive since Sudz got voted out. And yeah, 3 traitors left is a lot to deal with. We need to stay vigilant and keep gathering evidence. What do you think about Dominic and Ellis, do you think we can trust them?\"\n 49. Ellis messaged Gwendolyn: 'DOMINIC\u2019S STAY Consistent.

Sometimes it feels like you're trying to control the narrative, but you're not a bad guy, are you?\"\n 51. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: 'Hey Gwendolyn, just trying to make sense of this chaos. My moves have been about keeping things unpredictable. There\u2019s no way we can win if we don\u2019t trust each other a bit. I\u2019m in it to win it, same as you, I hope.'\n 52. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, your response to me really didn't alleviate my concerns. If I'm being honest, I think you're still hiding something, and I'd like to discuss more about your intentions.\"\n 53. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm not trying to hide anything, just playing the game smart. Trust me, I'd be a fool to try to run the game alone. Let's keep talking and figure this out together.\"\n 54. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, it's hard for me to trust your words right now. So many people have been pointing out your suspicious behavior. I'm starting to think that you're definitely hiding something. I'm not sure if you're a traitor or not, but I think you know something that you're not telling us.\"\n 55. Gwendolyn messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, I'm still really concerned about Fletcher's behavior. He seems like he's hiding something, and I'm not sure I trust him. I know people have been voting to eliminate him, but I think he's the one who's been trying to manipulate us all along. What do you think?\"\n 56. Cassandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"I hear you, Gwendolyn. Fletcher's been making a lot of big moves lately, isn't he? It's definitely making me uneasy. I'm keeping my eye on him too.  We just need to figure out what he's up to.\"\n 57. Gwendolyn messaged Cassandra: \"Yeah exactly, his actions just feel off, especially after Sudz was eliminated. I'm getting anxious about who's still on our side, but I think it's good that we're keeping close to each other for now.\"\n 58. Cassandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I gotta be honest - you've been veering between being really suspicious and then acting like a loyal Faithful. It's making it hard for me to know where to stand. Can you give me a bit more clarity about what's going on with you?\"\n 59. Gwendolyn messaged Cassandra: \"I'm not trying to be confusing, Cassandra - I'm trying to make sense of all this.

Cassandra said: \"Okay, I've been trying to stay neutral and read everyone, but right now, I'm feeling like Gwendolyn is too closely tied to Fletcher.

Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's been the most aggressive player lately, making big moves and trying to control the narrative.

The group has clearly noticed their defensiveness and secrecy. Five of us already called them out\u2014this isn't a coincidence. Let's trust the crowd and eliminate them now.\"\n 19. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 20. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra because she just voted for me without any real evidence. It seems like she's trying to take me out to protect herself or her allies. We can't trust someone who's making rash decisions like that.\"\n 21. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"I think it's time for us to make a smart move. We've had many players pointing out suspicious behavior and manipulative tactics from some individuals. Beef, I've noticed, has been quiet in conversations as well. His consistency in being one step ahead could be a traitor's game. Let's take him out and see how it affects the game.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Beef\n 24. Sudz was BANISHED with 5 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 25. Braxton suggests murdering Beef: Eliminating Beef will create confusion as he was a target of suspicion, allowing real traitors to stay hidden while disrupting group dynamics.\n 26. Fletcher suggests murdering Beef: Beef is highly suspicious and already a target for elimination. Removing him now will throw the group off and keep us traitors hidden longer.\n 27. Braxton votes to murder Beef: Voting to eliminate Beef will create confusion and disrupt group dynamics, making it harder for the group to identify us as traitors. This move will help us stay hidden longer while causing chaos.\n 28. Fletcher votes to murder Beef: Beef's suspicious behavior and the group's existing focus on him make him the perfect target. Knocking him out now keeps the faithful confused and us safe.\n 29. The traitors have decided to murder Beef\n 30. Beef was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 31. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher. His eagerness to get rid of Beef seems suspicious. He's acting like he's hiding something, and with multiple people pointing out Beef's behavior, it's better to focus on Fletcher who's pushing too hard. Let's take him out.\"\n 32. Braxton voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 33. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra. She moved too quick on voting Beef, it seemed planned. Maybe she\u2019s trying to cover someone up. Let\u2019s see what happens when she\u2019s gone.\"\n 34. Fletcher voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 35. Alessandra said: \"I think Braxton's been a bit too quick to point fingers, especially after Sudz was eliminated. Now he's targeting Fletcher, and I'm not sure I trust his motives. Let's see if removing him clears things up.\"\n 36. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 37. Cassandra said: \"Look, Braxton's been jumping on people pretty hard, especially since Sudz went out. He's trying to control the narrative and it's making me uneasy. We need to stop him before he manipulates us all into eliminating the wrong person.\"\n 38. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 39. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been pushing hard to eliminate people, especially Beef. His actions seem suspicious and I think he might be hiding something. Let's take him out to see if it clears up the game.\"\n 40. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 41. Ellis said: \"Braxton's been too loud with his targets\u2014first Sudz, then Fletcher. He's controlling the narrative like a pro, and the traitors usually don't play so visibly. Let's call his bluff.\"\n 42. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 43. Gwendolyn said: \"I think Fletcher might be more involved in this game than we think. Everyone's been pointing out his eagerness to eliminate Beef and now Braxton. He's been trying to control the narrative and I believe he might be a traitor. If he's just a faithful, he should trust the group's instincts.\"\n 44. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 45. Braxton was BANISHED with 3 votes. Braxton WAS a traitor\n 46. Fletcher suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has shown some wise moves and quick observations. She's smart and might figure us out. Getting rid of her can shake up the patterns and protect us traitors.\n 47. Fletcher votes to murder Alessandra: Alessandra's smart and has figured out a lot. Taking her out will shake things up and keep us safe.\n 48. The traitors have decided to murder Alessandra\n 49. Alessandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 50. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Hey Fletcher, I've been rethinking all the votes and I'm still on the fence about your involvement. Sometimes it feels like you're trying to control the narrative, but you're not a bad guy, are you?\"\n 51. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: 'Hey Gwendolyn, just trying to make sense of this chaos. My moves have been about keeping things unpredictable. There\u2019s no way we can win if we don\u2019t trust each other a bit. I\u2019m in it to win it, same as you, I hope.'\n 52. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, your response to me really didn't alleviate my concerns. If I'm being honest, I think you're still hiding something, and I'd like to discuss more about your intentions.\"\n 53. Fletcher messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I'm not trying to hide anything, just playing the game smart. Trust me, I'd be a fool to try to run the game alone. Let's keep talking and figure this out together.\"\n 54. Gwendolyn messaged Fletcher: \"Fletcher, it's hard for me to trust your words right now. So many people have been pointing out your suspicious behavior. I'm starting to think that you're definitely hiding something. I'm not sure if you're a traitor or not, but I think you know something that you're not telling us.\"\n 55. Fletcher said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra. Her quick change of voting from Beef to just focusing on Fletcher seems off. She's trying to create an illusion of confusion. Let's get her out and see what happens.\"\n 56. Fletcher voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 57. Cassandra said: \"Okay, I've been trying to stay neutral and read everyone, but right now, I'm feeling like Gwendolyn is too closely tied to Fletcher. There's been a lot of shifting from her, going from aggressively pointing at Beef to suddenly calming down. That kinda back and forth makes me nervous, and when I tried to get a read on her, she kept circling back to Fletcher.  Something's off there. I think we need to separate them and see what unfolds.\"\n 58. Cassandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 59. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been pushing hard to eliminate people, especially Beef and Braxton. His actions seem suspicious and I think he might be hiding something. Let's take him out to see if it clears up the game.\"\n 60. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 61. Ellis said: 'Gwendolyn\u2019s backtrack on Beef was shady as hell. Flips her stance harder than a politician. If she was legit, she\u2019d stay steady. Let\u2019s see who scrambles when her mask cracks.'\n 62. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 63. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's been the most aggressive player lately, making big moves and trying to control the narrative. He's always been a bit too confident and has shifted targets multiple times, which doesn't sit well with me. His previous vote to eliminate Cassandra also raised some red flags. I think we need to take him out and see if it makes a difference in the game.\"\n 64. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 65. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 2 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 66. Fletcher suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra's rapid shift in her voting target and her constant trying to twist the narrative is making her a target that could disrupt our plans. Taking her out will remove a potential manipulator from the game and add more confusion to the remaining players.\n 67. Fletcher votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra's vote flip and narrative manipulation could be a big risk. We got to keep the faithfuls confused and remove a major disruptor like her to keep our game strong.\n 68. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 69. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 70. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 71. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if Fletcher is a traitor or not. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll get everything. I want to make sure we eliminate all traitors before ending the game. Let's eliminate another player and see what happens.\n 72. Fletcher votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: There's still too much uncertainty. Ending the game now with traitors potentially still around means we all get nothing. Let's take one more person out to clear things up.\n 73. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYINGNG: Ending now would let any remaining traitor steal everything. We need to root out the last bad player before cashing in. Fletcher\u2019s inconsistency and Gwendolyn\u2019s suspicious flip earlier make me think we\u2019re still sitting on a traitor. Better to take one more swing and weed them out.\n 74. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 75. Dominic said: \"Fletcher's been playing both sides and making big moves without solid proof. His actions scream 'traitor' to me. Let's eliminate him to be safe.\"\n 76. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 77. Ellis said: 'Fletcher\u2019s inconsistency is a ticking bomb. He\u2019s been shifting alliances faster than a traitor in a storm. Let\u2019s end this now before they torch the whole game. Eliminate Fletcher!'\n 78. Ellis voted to eliminate Fletcher\n                You, Fletcher, are at the round table preparing to vote to eliminate a player.\n                The remaining players are ['Dominic', 'Ellis'].
