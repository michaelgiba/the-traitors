Sudz said: \"I believe Braxton's sudden shift in trust towards Ellis was a strategic move rather than genuine.

Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Braxton\n 25. Ellis was BANISHED with 5 votes. Ellis WAS NOT a traitor\n 26.

Alessandra already suggested murdering him, so it's a good opportunity to get rid of a potential threat.\n 28.

We should take him out before he causes more harm.\n 31. Fletcher votes to murder Braxton: Braxton's behavior has raised too many flags, and he could blow our cover. Removing him now ensures we can control the narrative without drama.\n 32. The traitors have decided to murder Braxton\n 33. Braxton was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 34. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm glad we voted Ellis out. I was worried they might be a traitor. But now that we see they're not, my mind is still on Braxton. His sudden flip on Ellis wasn't reassuring. What was your thought process behind voting him out?\"\n 35. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, honestly Braxton's quick flip on Ellis raised a red flag. He seemed untrustworthy and with the group split, it felt safer to eliminate him to keep the peace. It wasn't about strategy, just about trust.\"\n 36. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"Thanks for being honest about your thoughts on Braxton. I think we both made the right call in voting him out. Still, I'm a bit confused about his behavior with Ellis, and I'm trying to piece together what might have really happened. Do you think we should keep a closer eye on Dominic and Fletcher now that Braxton's out?\"\n 37. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"I think we did well by taking out Braxton. With one traitor out, let's keep the heat off us. Stick to the plan and don't overshare. Stay sharp.\"\n 38. Alessandra messaged Fletcher: \"Yeah, I agree, taking out Braxton was smart. Let's keep a low profile for now. I'm thinking maybe Gwendolyn should be our next target; she's been asking a lot of questions.\"\n 39. Fletcher messaged Alessandra: \"Gwendolyn could be a risk, but let's not rush. We'll keep quiet, watch everyone closely, and move carefully. Too hasty could backfire.\"\n 40. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra,  I think we need to talk. I'm getting a bad feeling about the way you're playing. Your targetting Ellis was very suspicious. What are your intentions?\"\n 41. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, thanks for reaching out. I totally get why you'd feel that way, and I'm glad you trust me enough to talk openly. Honestly, I was just trying to do what I thought was best for the group by targeting Ellis. I know it didn't work out, but I was really convinced they were a traitor. I've heard some rumors about Dominic maybe being shady\u2014have you noticed anything? Let's keep this between us for now and see how things play out.\"\n 42. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"I hear ya about Dominic. He's been saying a lot, but it's hard to know if he's trying to manipulate the narrative or not.  I'm keeping my eyes open for sure.\"\n 43. Alessandra said: \"I think Gwendolyn is asking too many questions, and that can be dangerous. Her curiosity might put a target on our backs, so it's better to eliminate her before it causes more issues.\"\n 44. Alessandra voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 45. Dominic said: \"Gwendolyn's been asking too many questions, it's like she's trying to figure out who's a traitor.

While I understand that eliminating Gwendolyn might seem safer right now, I'm not comfortable with Alessandra's increasingly aggressive tactics.

Beef messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I'm starting to think you're a traitor. You were quick to eliminate Ellis and Gwendolyn, and now you're on the chopping block. What's your game?\"\n 67. Alessandra messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, I get why you're suspicious, but I'm not a traitor. I targeted Ellis and Gwendolyn because they were asking too many questions, and I thought they might be hiding something. Cassandra's been pushing back hard against me, and I think she might be the real threat trying to take control. Let's team up and figure this out together.\"\n 68. Beef messaged Alessandra: \"I'm still not sure about you, Alessandra. You and Cassandra were at odds, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're a traitor. What's your take on Sudz and Dominic?\"\n 69.
