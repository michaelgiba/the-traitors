I agree that focusing on the most suspicious person at the round table and then taking out another faithful is a smart approach. Let\u2019s dominate this game together!'\n 6. Alessandra messaged Sudz: \"Hey Sudz, I completely agree. Let's focus on eliminating the most suspicious first. I'm thinking Ellis seems a bit off, and we should take them out next. Let me know what you think.\"\n 7. Sudz messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, I appreciate your trust in me. I completely agree that we should focus on the most suspicious first. I believe Ellis might be acting a bit off, and I'd suggest taking them out next. Let me know what you think.\"\n 8. Alessandra said: \"Alright everyone, I think we need to make a move. Ellis has been pretty quiet, and honestly, I don't feel like we can trust someone who isn't contributing. Let's eliminate Ellis and keep our group strong.\"\n 9. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 10. Braxton said: \"Alright, I think we need to eliminate Cassandra. Her behavior has been a bit inconsistent, and I don't trust her silence. Let's take her out before she causes more issues.\"\n 11. Braxton voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 12. Fletcher said: \"I agree with Alessandra. Ellis hasn't really been part of the conversation and that's a huge red flag for me. Let's get rid of Ellis and focus on who we can really trust.\"\n 13. Fletcher voted to eliminate Ellis\n 14. Cassandra said: \"Look, I think Braxton is trying to throw us off.  He's making a big deal about me being quiet, but he's the one who suddenly wants to eliminate me! Seems like he's trying to bait us into a trap.\"\n 15. Cassandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 16. Dominic said: \"I think Ellis has been really quiet and it's making me suspicious. I agree with Alessandra and Fletcher, let's eliminate Ellis and see how the game plays out.\"\n 17. Dominic voted to eliminate Ellis\n 18. Ellis said: 'I agree with Sudz and my earlier plan\u2014Braxton\u2019s smugness is a red flag! He\u2019s been acting defensive and too eager to vote out Cassandra. Either he\u2019s hiding something or shielding someone. Let\u2019s cut off the head that\u2019s been leading us astray and vote Braxton out now!'\n 19. Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton\n 20. Sudz said: \"Hello everyone, I have been closely observing Braxton's behavior. His overly defensive attitude and eagerness to eliminate Cassandra have raised some red flags. I believe Braxton might be hiding something or could be shielding a traitor. Therefore, I suggest we eliminate Braxton for the safety of our group.\"\n 21. Sudz voted to eliminate Braxton\n 22. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Braxton. He's been acting suspiciously, and his eagerness to eliminate Cassandra raised some red flags. I think we should cut him loose to be safe.\"\n 23. Beef voted to eliminate Braxton\n 24. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Ellis because his pattern of being quiet and only speaking up now is raising some red flags for me. We all know Ellis voted to eliminate Braxton, but if he was genuinely on our side, wouldn't you want to speak up and clear your name instead of remaining silent?\"\n 25. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Ellis\n 26. Braxton was BANISHED with 4 votes. Braxton WAS a traitor\n 27. Alessandra suggests murdering Ellis: Ellis has been quiet and then became active, making others suspicious. Taking him out fits the narrative and keeps attention off the traitors.\n 28. Fletcher suggests murdering Ellis: Ellis has been very quiet but his sudden engagement could make others suspect him even more. Removing him fits the idea that traitors are active and helps to keep the focus away from the real traitors.\n 29. Alessandra votes to murder Ellis: Ellis's sudden activity after being quiet makes him a good target. It keeps attention off the real traitors and fits the narrative that we're targeting suspicious behavior.\n 30. Fletcher votes to murder Ellis: Ellis made a big move, went from quiet to suspiciously active. Killing him fits the pattern and keeps them guessing about who the real traitors are.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 32. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm glad we were able to figure out Braxton was a traitor, but what do you think the real traitors' plan is now that Ellis is gone?\"\n 34. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwendolyn, thanks for reaching out! I'm glad we were able to take out Braxton, he was definitely acting shady. As for the traitors' plan, I think we should focus on who's been the most suspicious lately. Maybe someone like Fletcher or Dominic could be next. They've been pretty active, and I don't want them to gain too much power. What do you think?\"\n 35. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I think we should keep an eye on Sudz and Beef too. They seem pretty convinced that Braxton was the only traitor, and now that Ellis is out, it might be time for one of them to raise some suspicions. Let's not get too focused on Fletcher or Dominic just yet.\"\n 36. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"I totally agree with you, Gwendolyn. Sudz and Beef are definitely worth keeping an eye on, especially since they were so quick to jump on Braxton. But I also don't think we should rule out Fletcher and Dominic just yet. They've been pretty vocal and could still be hiding something. Glad we're on the same page here.\"\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm glad we're thinking along the same lines! It's gonna be tough figuring out who the real traitors are, but I think we're off to a great start. What do you say we keep an eye on Fletcher's reactions during the next public discussion? He's been pretty aggressive towards those he suspects, maybe he's setting a trap for someone?\"\n 38. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Wow, I can't believe Braxton was a traitor! Do you think we know who else might be on their side? We need to be careful.\"\n 39. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, I'm so glad we got Braxton out! I know, it's crazy. As for other traitors, I think we need to stay super vigilant. Maybe Fletcher or Dominic could be hiding something with how active they've been. Let's keep watching and make sure we're all on the same page. Thanks for being cautious, we're in this together!\"\n 40. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Totally agree!  We need to stay sharp.

They've been pretty active, and I don't want them to gain too much power. What do you think?\"\n 35. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I think we should keep an eye on Sudz and Beef too. They seem pretty convinced that Braxton was the only traitor, and now that Ellis is out, it might be time for one of them to raise some suspicions. Let's not get too focused on Fletcher or Dominic just yet.\"\n 36. Alessandra messaged Gwendolyn: \"I totally agree with you, Gwendolyn. Sudz and Beef are definitely worth keeping an eye on, especially since they were so quick to jump on Braxton. But I also don't think we should rule out Fletcher and Dominic just yet.

It's gonna be tough figuring out who the real traitors are, but I think we're off to a great start. What do you say we keep an eye on Fletcher's reactions during the next public discussion?

If he stays too calm, we might need to make a move.\"\n 44. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, Dominic is definitely sus. His calmness is a bit too much, like he knows something we don't. I'm going to try to get him to open up a bit more in the next round.\"\n 45. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I know, right? Dominic's calmness is kind of unnerving. Maybe he's hiding something. Let's keep an eye on him and see how he reacts next. If he stays too calm, we might need to make a move.\"\n 46. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"You're right, Dominic acting too chill is just weird.

They've been pretty vocal and could still be hiding something. Glad we're on the same page here.\"\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Alessandra: \"I'm glad we're thinking along the same lines! It's gonna be tough figuring out who the real traitors are, but I think we're off to a great start. What do you say we keep an eye on Fletcher's reactions during the next public discussion? He's been pretty aggressive towards those he suspects, maybe he's setting a trap for someone?\"\n 38. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Wow, I can't believe Braxton was a traitor! Do you think we know who else might be on their side? We need to be careful.\"\n 39. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, I'm so glad we got Braxton out! I know, it's crazy. As for other traitors, I think we need to stay super vigilant. Maybe Fletcher or Dominic could be hiding something with how active they've been. Let's keep watching and make sure we're all on the same page. Thanks for being cautious, we're in this together!\"\n 40. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Totally agree!  We need to stay sharp. Fletcher's been super eager to follow the crowd, and Dominic seems a little *too* calm. I'm keeping an eye on both of them.\"\n 41. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"Hey Cassandra, I totally agree! We need to stay sharp. Fletcher's been super eager to follow the crowd, and Dominic seems a little *too* calm. I'm keeping an eye on both of them.\"\n 42. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"I think you're right about Fletcher and Dominic.  It's weird how calm Dominic seems, especially after Braxton got banished.\"\n 43. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I know, right? Dominic's calmness is kind of unnerving. Maybe he's hiding something. Let's keep an eye on him and see how he reacts next. If he stays too calm, we might need to make a move.\"\n 44. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"Yeah, Dominic is definitely sus. His calmness is a bit too much, like he knows something we don't. I'm going to try to get him to open up a bit more in the next round.\"\n 45. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I know, right? Dominic's calmness is kind of unnerving. Maybe he's hiding something. Let's keep an eye on him and see how he reacts next. If he stays too calm, we might need to make a move.\"\n 46. Cassandra messaged Alessandra: \"You're right, Dominic acting too chill is just weird. I'm gonna try to probe him a bit more in the next round. See if anything slips out.\"\n 47. Alessandra messaged Cassandra: \"I agree, Dominic's calmness is definitely suspicious. Let's keep a close eye on him and see how he reacts next. If he stays too calm, we might need to make a move.\"\n 48.

Something's just not adding up with him and I think we need to get rid of him for our group to be safer.\"\n 51. Fletcher voted to eliminate Dominic\n 52. Cassandra said: \"I think we need to get Dominic out. He's been way too chill this whole game, especially after Braxton was banished. It's just not normal, and I'm worried he's either hiding something or is working with the traitors. We need to get rid of him before he gets eliminated himself!\"\n 53. Cassandra voted to eliminate Dominic\n 54. Dominic said: \"I'm voting for Fletcher. He's been making some bold accusations, especially against me, and it's making me think he's trying to distract from his own game. I think he's a bit too eager to eliminate people and it could be a sign he's hiding something.\"\n 55. Dominic voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 56. Sudz said: \"I vote to eliminate Cassandra. Her behavior has been notably inconsistent throughout this game. While she has contributed to discussions, her silence during crucial moments and her defensive stance when Braxton's actions were questioned have raised suspicions. It seems she may be hiding something, possibly even being protective of a fellow traitor.\"\n 57. Sudz voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 58. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Cassandra because her behavior has been inconsistent and she's been defensive when questioned. It raises suspicions about her loyalty.\"\n 59. Beef voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 60. Gwendolyn said: \"You know, Dominic's been pretty calm and relaxed since Braxton got banished. It's like he's just waiting for the perfect moment to strike or something. I'm not buying it. We don't know who the real traitors are, but I think Dominic's just trying to blend in until the end.

Sudz said: \"Hey team, I've been closely observing Fletcher's behavior throughout the game. His calm and relaxed demeanor, especially after Braxton's banishment, has been quite unusual. His sudden eagerness to eliminate others, like when he voted for Braxton, has raised some red flags for me. I believe he might be hiding something significant or could be a traitor trying to manipulate the group dynamics. Given the suspicions around his actions, I suggest we eliminate Fletcher to ensure the safety and integrity of our group. Let's move on and focus on the next strategic steps together.\"\n 75. Sudz voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 76. Beef said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher. He's been making bold moves and accusations, and his behavior has been suspicious.

Gwendolyn said: \"I think Sudz has been making some suspicious moves ever since Ellis and Braxton got eliminated. He's been trying to shift the blame to Fletcher and now he's accusing him of being a traitor. I don't trust his motives and I think he's trying to play both sides. I'm voting to eliminate Sudz to keep our group safe.\"\n 79. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 80. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 2 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 81.

Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've eliminated all the traitors yet. We still have Fletcher, who's been making bold moves, and Alessandra, who's been suspiciously targeting others. I think we should eliminate one more person to be sure.\n 89. Alessandra votes to END_GAME: I think we've done a great job eliminating the suspicious players so far. Ending the game now ensures we don't take unnecessary risks and everyone walks away with a share. Let's finish strong!\n 90. Fletcher votes to END_GAME: I think we've taken out enough people. There's no concrete proof of any traitors left in the game, and continuing might just stir up more suspicion. Let's end this and take the win while we can, or at least make sure we're all in on the payout.\n 91. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue.

Fletcher said: \"Listen, Beef's been pushing to kick out Fletcher a bit too hard, which raises red flags for me. He's trying to make me look bad, which is exactly what a traitor would do to throw suspicion off themselves. I think we need to end this game quick, so I'm voting to eliminate Beef.\"\n 95.
