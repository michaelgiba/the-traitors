'Beef' selected as a traitor.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Alessandra', 'Beef', 'Braxton', 'Cassandra', 'Dominic', 'Ellis', 'Fletcher', 'Gwendolyn', 'Sudz']\n 3. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Beef, I dunno about you, but I'm keepin' eyes on Gwendolyn and Sudz. They both seem kinda secretive. What do you think?\"\n 4. Beef messaged Fletcher: \"Yeah, I'm watching them too, especially Sudz. They're super quiet.\"\n 5. Fletcher messaged Beef: \"Beef, let's also keep a close eye on Alessandra and Dominic. They've been pretty confident, might be hiding something.\"\n 6. Alessandra said: \"Sudz, I've noticed you've been really quiet and not sharing much info. I think you're hiding something, so I gotta vote you out.\"\n 7. Alessandra voted to eliminate Sudz\n 8. Sudz said: \"Everyone's been really quiet around Gwendolyn. I can't put my finger on it, but something feels off about her. I think she's hiding something that could be dangerous for us all.\"\n 9. Sudz voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 10. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Gwendolyn. Sudz brought up a good point about her being suspicious, and I think we should check her out.\"\n 11. Beef voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 12. Braxton said: \"I've noticed Gwendolyn's lack of interaction and it's concerning. Her silence could be hiding something. I support eliminating her to ensure our group's safety.\"\n 13. Braxton voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 14. Cassandra said: \"I'm going to vote Alessandra out. She was the one who first brought up suspicion and even though I understand she was trying to get the ball rolling, it feels like she's being a little too eager to eliminate people. And honestly, she kind of wasted  a vote on Sudz earlier, which makes me wonder what her true motives are.\"\n 15. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 16. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Cassandra. Her reasoning for voting Alessandra out seemed shaky to me. If we eliminate the wrong person, the traitors win. I think we should give Alessandra a chance to prove herself.\"\n 17. Dominic voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 18. Ellis said: \"I'm voting out Gwendolyn too. Between her sudden silence, Beef and Braxton jumping on her, and Sudz calling her out, I think this is too much smoke for no fire. Vote Gwen!\"\n 19. Ellis voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 20. Fletcher said: \"Hey all, I think Gwendolyn has been acting really suspicious. She's been quiet and keeping to herself a lot, and with so many people pointing towards her, I think we need to take action now.\"\n 21. Fletcher voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 22. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. We all know he's been shady and pointing fingers. We trusted him at first, but his sudden accusations against me seem very traitor-like. I think we should take out the threat, Sudz.\"\n 23. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Sudz\n 24. Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 5 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 25. Alessandra suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra is getting too close to figuring out I'm a traitor. She voted against me, and if she keeps pushing, she might expose me. Taking her out now is the best move to protect myself and keep the other traitors safe.\n 26. Sudz suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic voted against me in the first round and hasn't really contributed to the discussion since. I think he's starting to get suspicious and could potentially expose us. I would prefer to eliminate him before he figures it out and puts us all in danger.\n 27. Beef suggests murdering Dominic: Dominic is getting too suspicious and voted against a fellow traitor's target, showing he's on the right track. We should take him out before he figures us out.\n 28. Alessandra votes to murder Cassandra: Cassandra is onto me and voted against me, so eliminating her protects me and the other traitors. She's a direct threat and needs to be taken out now.\n 29. Sudz votes to murder Dominic: Dominic has shown suspicion towards traitors and voted against Alessandra, which makes him a potential threat to the group's unity and the success of the traitors' plans. Eliminate him to prevent him from uncovering the traitors' identities.\n 30. Beef votes to murder Dominic: Dominic is getting too suspicious and voted against a fellow traitor's target. We need to take him out before he figures us out.\n 31. The traitors have decided to murder Dominic\n 32. Dominic was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 33. Beef messaged Sudz: \"Sudz, now that Gwendolyn's gone and Dominic's out, we need to keep an eye on Cassandra and Ellis. They seem to be paying close attention to everyone's moves.\"\n 34. Sudz messaged Beef: \"Cassandra's and Ellis's attention is too focused.
