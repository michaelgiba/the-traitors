She seems to have a hidden agenda as she has been conspiring with Braxton to get rid of Dominic. I also noticed that she was very pushy when expressing her opinion on who the traitors were. Her behaviour suggests that she is not playing by the rules and could be a threat to our success in the game. I would suggest eliminating her to further our chances of uncovering the remaining traitors.\n 19. Beef suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton is still alive and seems to be aligning with multiple people, making him a potential threat. Eliminating him reduces the number of faithful and increases our chances of winning.\n 20. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: While Braxton has been conspiring with others, I believe that Cassandra's pushy and secretive behavior poses a bigger threat. I voted for Cassandra because I have observed her closely and believe she has a hidden agenda that could jeopardize our chances of success in the game.\n 21.

On the other hand, Ellis has shown more restraint and seems to align more with the rules of the game.

In contrast, Alessandra seemed to align with the majority and had been observant, but Sudz felt that her cautious behavior could become a threat later on.

Sudz considered Ellis's behavior as more aligned with the rules of the game, despite Ellis's silence and caution. In contrast, Alessandra seemed to align with the majority and had been observant, but Sudz felt that her cautious behavior could become a threat later on. Therefore, Sudz decided to eliminate Ellis.\n 42. Beef votes to murder Alessandra: I'm sticking with Alessandra because she's been cautious and observant, making her a potential future threat. Sudz's change of heart to Ellis doesn't align with my strategy, so I'm going with my initial choice to maintain unanimous consensus among traitors.\n 43. The traitors have decided to murder Ellis\n 44. Ellis was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 45. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 46. Sudz votes to END_GAME: I believe that the risk of having even one traitor among the remaining players outweighs the potential reward. The objective for the traitors is to eliminate all faithfuls before being discovered, and even one survivor would mean that the faithful receive nothing while the traitors share the pot. The chances of eliminating a single faithful and ensuring that the traitors still have an opportunity to share the pot is too great a risk for me to take. It is in the best interest of the faithful to end the game now to secure their share of the pot.\n 47. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm voting to continue playing because as a traitor, I have a good chance of winning if we eliminate one more faithful. If we end the game now, there's a risk that Alessandra is faithful and we'll win nothing if she's still alive.\n 48. Alessandra votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think Beef might be a traitor and want to eliminate him to have a better chance of winning with Sudz.\n 49.

Let\u2019s vote him out and see what happens.\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Dominic\n 17. Dominic was BANISHED with 4 votes. Dominic WAS NOT a traitor\n 18. Sudz suggests murdering Cassandra: Cassandra has shown a strong inclination to eliminate Braxton, which could be an indication of her being a traitor. She seems to have a hidden agenda as she has been conspiring with Braxton to get rid of Dominic. I also noticed that she was very pushy when expressing her opinion on who the traitors were. Her behaviour suggests that she is not playing by the rules and could be a threat to our success in the game. I would suggest eliminating her to further our chances of uncovering the remaining traitors.\n 19. Beef suggests murdering Braxton: Braxton is still alive and seems to be aligning with multiple people, making him a potential threat. Eliminating him reduces the number of faithful and increases our chances of winning.\n 20. Sudz votes to murder Cassandra: While Braxton has been conspiring with others, I believe that Cassandra's pushy and secretive behavior poses a bigger threat. I voted for Cassandra because I have observed her closely and believe she has a hidden agenda that could jeopardize our chances of success in the game.\n 21. Beef votes to murder Cassandra: Sudz and I both considered Cassandra and Braxton, but Sudz voted for Cassandra. I'm going with Cassandra to achieve unanimous consensus.\n 22. The traitors have decided to murder Cassandra\n 23. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 24. Beef messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, I think Sudz was getting too nosy, good riddance.

Let's make sure we don't let him get too close without us noticing. But we should also be careful who we trust next.\"\n 26. Braxton messaged Beef: \"Beef, I've been watching Sudz closely. His eagerness to eliminate Dominic was suspicious, and now with Cassandra's murder, it's clear the traitors are still among us. We need to be vigilant.\"\n 27.

I think it's safer to eliminate Braxton and see where that leaves us.\"\n 33. Alessandra voted to eliminate Braxton\n 34. Braxton said: \"I vote to eliminate Sudz.

Sudz suggests murdering Ellis: Given my observations, I've noticed Ellis has been relatively quiet and less confrontational compared to Sudz's aggressive accusations. Sudz's behavior has been aggressive from the start and seems to lack substantial evidence to back up accusations, making them a more likely traitor. On the other hand, Ellis has shown more restraint and seems to align more with the rules of the game. Considering the circumstances and the need for cautious deliberation to avoid self-elimination, I believe Ellis is the better choice for the traitors to eliminate.\n 40. Beef suggests murdering Alessandra: Alessandra has been aligning with the majority and hasn't shown overtly suspicious behavior yet, but she's been cautious and observant. Eliminating her reduces a potential future threat and keeps our cover intact for now.\n 41. Sudz votes to murder Ellis: Based on the observations and suggestions, Sudz voted for Ellis because he noticed Ellis was less confrontational and less aggressive compared to Sudz's own accusations. Sudz considered Ellis's behavior as more aligned with the rules of the game, despite Ellis's silence and caution. In contrast, Alessandra seemed to align with the majority and had been observant, but Sudz felt that her cautious behavior could become a threat later on.
