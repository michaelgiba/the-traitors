Maybe we should keep an eye on him.\"\n 4. Braxton messaged Alessandra: \"Hey Alessandra, thanks for reaching out. I get where you're coming from, but I think we need more concrete info before pointing fingers. Maybe we should observe Beef a bit more closely and see if anything stands out. Also, it might be good to keep an eye on others too, just to be safe. Let's stay vigilant and maybe talk more later. - Braxton\"\n 5. Braxton messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I was just thinking, with everything going on, have you noticed anything suspicious about anyone else?

I\u2019ve noticed the same red flags others have mentioned. Let\u2019s stick together on this\u2014strength in numbers. If we split, the Traitors win. Beef\u2019s silence doesn\u2019t feel right.
