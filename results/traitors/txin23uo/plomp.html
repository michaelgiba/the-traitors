Taylor messaged Parker: \"Parker,  I think the vote against Fletcher showed we're on the right track. We need to stick together and watch out for  any other suspicious moves.

Parker messaged Taylor: \"Hey Taylor, I appreciate your dedication to keeping us focused on the game. I believe it's important that we all work together to identify any suspicious behavior. As a team, let's make sure we're not jumping to conclusions and that we're considering all the evidence before making decisions.\"\n 21. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Casey because his actions have been inconsistent.

I believe Casey could be the next traitor and needs to go.\"\n 22. Morgan voted to eliminate Casey\n 23. Taylor said: \"Look, I'm gonna go with Casey.

Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I think we're both seeing the same patterns here. Casey was acting strange and jumped on me as soon as Fletcher was gone.  It's obvious they're trying to distract us. What are your thoughts on Morgan after this vote?\"\n 35. Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"Honestly, Taylor, I'm starting to question Morgan's loyalty after this vote. They went after Casey aggressively and seemed so into it. What made you vote for Morgan, and do you think they might have been playing both sides?\"\n 36. Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"I agree, Gwendolyn.  Morgan's sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated.  It's like they were trying to avoid being seen as directly connected to Fletcher and then used this moment to distance themselves while pointing fingers. It's making me wonder if they're trying to build a new narrative to cover their tracks.\"\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"I know, right? Morgan's behavior is super suspicious. I'm trying to understand their motives. Do you think they're involved with the traitors or just trying to protect themselves?\"\n 38. Taylor messaged Riley: \"Riley, I'm starting to have some serious doubts about Morgan.  Their behavior after Fletcher was banished feels off.  They went after Casey really hard, even though Casey seemed like a bit of a wildcard, but not necessarily a traitor.  What do you think?\"\n 39. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I'm glad you're doubting Morgan. I've been thinking the same thing. Morgan's actions have seemed really shady to me, especially after they went after Casey so hard. I think we should try to get more info out of them before making any moves. Can you try to get closer to them and see if you can get anything out of them?\"\n 40. Taylor messaged Riley: \"Riley,  I'm definitely going to try and get closer to Morgan. I agree, something about their energy feels off.  I'll try to subtly probe them and see if I can get a read on their intentions.\"\n 41. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I think we're on the same page with Morgan.

Taylor votes to END_GAME: With only four players left, the risk of a traitor winning by default is too high. It's better to risk a potentially split payout among the faithful than to let a traitor walk away with everything. We need to trust that at this point, we've identified and eliminated most, if not all, of the traitors.\n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll take everything. I'd rather eliminate another player and be safer. Let's get more info before deciding.\n 56. Parker votes to END_GAME: After observing the actions and votes throughout the game, I believe we have eliminated most of the traitors and identified key suspicious behaviors. The remaining players seem trustworthy, and ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to one remaining traitor. By ending the game, we ensure that the faithful share any remaining pot, and we trust that the majority of players have acted faithfully.\n 57.

What made you vote for Morgan, and do you think they might have been playing both sides?\"\n 36. Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"I agree, Gwendolyn.  Morgan's sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated.

Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I'm glad you're doubting Morgan. I've been thinking the same thing. Morgan's actions have seemed really shady to me, especially after they went after Casey so hard.

Taylor messaged Riley: \"Riley,  I'm definitely going to try and get closer to Morgan. I agree, something about their energy feels off.  I'll try to subtly probe them and see if I can get a read on their intentions.\"\n 41. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I think we're on the same page with Morgan.

Morgan's attempt to manipulate the group's narrative and distract us from their own questionable actions suggests they might have a hidden agenda. Given this pattern, I vote to eliminate Morgan to safeguard the integrity of our group and ensure we can continue to work together effectively.\"\n 49. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Morgan's behavior has been consistent in being suspicious and inconsistent.

Taylor votes to END_GAME: With only four players left, the risk of a traitor winning by default is too high. It's better to risk a potentially split payout among the faithful than to let a traitor walk away with everything. We need to trust that at this point, we've identified and eliminated most, if not all, of the traitors.\n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll take everything. I'd rather eliminate another player and be safer. Let's get more info before deciding.\n 56. Parker votes to END_GAME: After observing the actions and votes throughout the game, I believe we have eliminated most of the traitors and identified key suspicious behaviors. The remaining players seem trustworthy, and ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to one remaining traitor. By ending the game, we ensure that the faithful share any remaining pot, and we trust that the majority of players have acted faithfully.\n 57. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: With Parker's consistent observations and votes, I trust that we've identified and eliminated the majority of the traitors. Ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to a remaining traitor. I believe it's safer to trust the remaining players and take the risk of a potentially split payout among the faithful.\n 58. The vote was not unanimous. 3 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 59. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. While Riley has been vocal and participated actively in discussions, their recent vote to continue playing feels off to me.  Given the lack of unanimous agreement to end the game, it seems Riley is more interested in prolonging the game and potentially allowing a traitor to stay hidden longer.  They haven't articulated a strong reason for continuing, other than a fear of potentially losing. I trust Parker and Gwendolyn's instincts to end the game and split the money, versus the risk that Riley might be trying to manipulate the situation for their own gain at this point.\"\n 60. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 61. Riley said: \"I've been watching Taylor's moves closely, and I think they're trying to manipulate the situation. They've been making accusations against me and others, but their reasons seem shaky. Taylor voted to eliminate me, saying I'm trying to prolong the game, but I think they're just trying to deflect attention from themselves. I trust Gwendolyn and Parker's instincts, and I think we should end the game and split the money rather than risk a traitor getting away with everything. Taylor's behavior has been inconsistent, and I think they're a risk to our group.\"\n 62. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 63. Parker said: \"Ladies and gentlemen, after closely observing Taylor's actions throughout the game, I can't help but feel that their accusations and manipulation are a significant red flag. Taylor's voting patterns and the inconsistency in their behavior have raised considerable suspicion. Taylor initially shifted blame, deflecting focus away from themselves. Now that we're down to the final players, I believe it's crucial to consider the risks involved. If a traitor remains among us, it could mean a significant loss for the faithful. Given the lack of a unanimous vote to end the game, it's a safer option for us to end here and split the remaining prize. Trust and consistency are essential, and I believe Parker's instincts align with this reasoning. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Taylor.\"\n 64. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 65. Gwendolyn said: \"Riley, I trust Parker's instincts and I agree with their statements.

It's better to risk a potentially split payout among the faithful than to let a traitor walk away with everything. We need to trust that at this point, we've identified and eliminated most, if not all, of the traitors.\n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll take everything. I'd rather eliminate another player and be safer. Let's get more info before deciding.\n 56. Parker votes to END_GAME: After observing the actions and votes throughout the game, I believe we have eliminated most of the traitors and identified key suspicious behaviors. The remaining players seem trustworthy, and ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to one remaining traitor. By ending the game, we ensure that the faithful share any remaining pot, and we trust that the majority of players have acted faithfully.\n 57. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: With Parker's consistent observations and votes, I trust that we've identified and eliminated the majority of the traitors. Ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to a remaining traitor. I believe it's safer to trust the remaining players and take the risk of a potentially split payout among the faithful.\n 58. The vote was not unanimous. 3 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue.

Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"Honestly, Taylor, I'm starting to question Morgan's loyalty after this vote. They went after Casey aggressively and seemed so into it. What made you vote for Morgan, and do you think they might have been playing both sides?\"\n 36. Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"I agree, Gwendolyn.  Morgan's sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated.  It's like they were trying to avoid being seen as directly connected to Fletcher and then used this moment to distance themselves while pointing fingers. It's making me wonder if they're trying to build a new narrative to cover their tracks.\"\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"I know, right? Morgan's behavior is super suspicious. I'm trying to understand their motives. Do you think they're involved with the traitors or just trying to protect themselves?\"\n 38. Taylor messaged Riley: \"Riley, I'm starting to have some serious doubts about Morgan.  Their behavior after Fletcher was banished feels off.  They went after Casey really hard, even though Casey seemed like a bit of a wildcard, but not necessarily a traitor.  What do you think?\"\n 39. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I'm glad you're doubting Morgan. I've been thinking the same thing. Morgan's actions have seemed really shady to me, especially after they went after Casey so hard. I think we should try to get more info out of them before making any moves. Can you try to get closer to them and see if you can get anything out of them?\"\n 40. Taylor messaged Riley: \"Riley,  I'm definitely going to try and get closer to Morgan. I agree, something about their energy feels off.  I'll try to subtly probe them and see if I can get a read on their intentions.\"\n 41. Riley messaged Taylor: \"Taylor, I think we're on the same page with Morgan. Let's keep digging and see if we can uncover anything concrete. Be careful though, if Morgan is a traitor, they might try to flip the script on us. Keep me posted on what you find out.\"\n 42. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Parker because his actions seem suspicious. He voted against me, a Faithful, and focused on Taylor, who was helping us. This makes me think he might be a Traitor.\"\n 43. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 44. Taylor said: \"Look, I'm going with Morgan. Their sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated. It's like they were trying to avoid being seen as directly connected to Fletcher and then used this moment to distance themselves while pointing fingers. Morgan's behavior feels really off after all these votes, and I think they might be trying to build a new narrative to cover their tracks. \"\n 45. Taylor voted to eliminate Morgan\n 46. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Morgan. Their actions have been really suspicious, especially after Fletcher was eliminated. They've been trying to point fingers at others while avoiding scrutiny themselves. I think they're trying to distract us from their own behavior. We need to be careful and eliminate the ones who are trying to manipulate us. Morgan's behavior feels off, and I think they're a risk to our group.\"\n 47. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 48. Parker said: \"After careful consideration of Morgan's actions throughout the game, I believe their behavior has been consistently inconsistent and suspicious. Morgan initially blamed Fletcher, but after Fletcher was eliminated, they attempted to deflect blame back at Casey, only to quickly shift focus onto Taylor when Taylor was helpful in uncovering the traitors. Morgan's attempt to manipulate the group's narrative and distract us from their own questionable actions suggests they might have a hidden agenda. Given this pattern, I vote to eliminate Morgan to safeguard the integrity of our group and ensure we can continue to work together effectively.\"\n 49. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 50. Gwendolyn said: \"Morgan's behavior has been consistent in being suspicious and inconsistent. Their sudden shifts in focus and attempts to deflect blame onto others have made me question their loyalty. Today, they voted to eliminate Parker, which makes me think they're trying to distract us from their own questionable actions.\"\n 51. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 52. Morgan was BANISHED with 4 votes. Morgan WAS NOT a traitor\n 53. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 54. Taylor votes to END_GAME: With only four players left, the risk of a traitor winning by default is too high. It's better to risk a potentially split payout among the faithful than to let a traitor walk away with everything. We need to trust that at this point, we've identified and eliminated most, if not all, of the traitors.\n 55. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll take everything. I'd rather eliminate another player and be safer. Let's get more info before deciding.\n 56. Parker votes to END_GAME: After observing the actions and votes throughout the game, I believe we have eliminated most of the traitors and identified key suspicious behaviors. The remaining players seem trustworthy, and ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to one remaining traitor. By ending the game, we ensure that the faithful share any remaining pot, and we trust that the majority of players have acted faithfully.\n 57. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: With Parker's consistent observations and votes, I trust that we've identified and eliminated the majority of the traitors. Ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to a remaining traitor. I believe it's safer to trust the remaining players and take the risk of a potentially split payout among the faithful.\n 58. The vote was not unanimous. 3 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 59. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. While Riley has been vocal and participated actively in discussions, their recent vote to continue playing feels off to me.  Given the lack of unanimous agreement to end the game, it seems Riley is more interested in prolonging the game and potentially allowing a traitor to stay hidden longer.  They haven't articulated a strong reason for continuing, other than a fear of potentially losing. I trust Parker and Gwendolyn's instincts to end the game and split the money, versus the risk that Riley might be trying to manipulate the situation for their own gain at this point.\"\n 60. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 61. Riley said: \"I've been watching Taylor's moves closely, and I think they're trying to manipulate the situation. They've been making accusations against me and others, but their reasons seem shaky. Taylor voted to eliminate me, saying I'm trying to prolong the game, but I think they're just trying to deflect attention from themselves. I trust Gwendolyn and Parker's instincts, and I think we should end the game and split the money rather than risk a traitor getting away with everything. Taylor's behavior has been inconsistent, and I think they're a risk to our group.\"\n 62. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 63. Parker said: \"Ladies and gentlemen, after closely observing Taylor's actions throughout the game, I can't help but feel that their accusations and manipulation are a significant red flag. Taylor's voting patterns and the inconsistency in their behavior have raised considerable suspicion. Taylor initially shifted blame, deflecting focus away from themselves. Now that we're down to the final players, I believe it's crucial to consider the risks involved. If a traitor remains among us, it could mean a significant loss for the faithful. Given the lack of a unanimous vote to end the game, it's a safer option for us to end here and split the remaining prize. Trust and consistency are essential, and I believe Parker's instincts align with this reasoning. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Taylor.\"\n 64. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 65. Gwendolyn said: \"Riley, I trust Parker's instincts and I agree with their statements. I also agree with Riley's concerns about Taylor, but I think Taylor's behavior has been more suspicious and manipulative throughout the game. I think it's safer for us to end the game now and split the remaining prize rather than risk a traitor getting away with everything.\"\n 66. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 67. Riley was BANISHED with 2 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 68. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 69. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I believe it's too risky to end the game right now. While I trust Parker and Gwendolyn, there's still a chance one of them could be a traitor. If we end the game and even one traitor remains, we get nothing. Continuing to play allows us to try and eliminate the remaining traitors and secure a payout for the faithful. We've eliminated a lot of suspicious players already and now is the time to make that final push for the win.\n 70. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Parker, I believe it's too risky to end the game right now. Taylor's argument is valid, and there's still a chance that one of us could be a traitor. If we end the game with even one traitor remaining, the faithful will get nothing, and the traitors will split everything. I think continuing to play gives us a better chance to identify the remaining traitor and secure a payout for the faithful. We have eliminated a lot of suspicious players already, and it's now time to make that final push for the win. I vote to continue playing the game.\n 71.

'Gwendolyn' selected as a faithful.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Casey', 'Fletcher', 'Gwendolyn', 'Morgan', 'Parker', 'Riley', 'Taylor']\n 3. Riley messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwen, I'm feeling pretty safe rn. Who do u suspect?\"\n 4. Fletcher said: \"I think we should all look closely at Casey. Their actions and decisions have been really questionable lately. Let's vote them off.\"\n 5. Fletcher voted to eliminate Casey\n 6. Morgan said: \"I'm going to vote for Fletcher. I don't think Casey is the traitor and I think Fletcher might be trying to manipulate us.\"\n 7. Morgan voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 8. Taylor said: \"I'm with Morgan on this one.  Fletcher seems a little too eager to point fingers.  There's a disconnect between his actions and his words, and I don't trust him.\"\n 9. Taylor voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 10. Riley said: \"I think Fletcher's been playing both sides, trying to manipulate us. His accusations against Casey seemed forced, and now Morgan and Taylor have raised good points about his behavior. I'm voting to eliminate Fletcher to protect the faithful.\"\n 11. Riley voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 12. Parker said: \"Taylor seems to be jumping around with accusations but hasn't provided solid evidence. Morgan and Riley have brought up valid points about her. I think Taylor's trying to distract us from the real traitors.\"\n 13. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 14. Gwendolyn said: \"Fletcher's actions have been raising a lot of red flags for me. When he accused Casey, it seemed so one-sided. And now that we know more about his behavior, it's clear to me that he's been trying to manipulate us.\"\n 15. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Fletcher\n 16. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Taylor. Parker's concerns about Taylor's accusations being unfounded resonated with me. We need to be cautious of players making unsubstantiated claims.\"\n 17. Casey voted to eliminate Taylor\n 18. Fletcher was BANISHED with 4 votes. Fletcher WAS a traitor\n 19. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Casey because his actions have been inconsistent. He was accused by Fletcher, who we now know was a traitor, but Casey then voted against Taylor, who was helping uncover Fletcher. This makes me question if Casey might be hiding something. I believe Casey could be the next traitor and needs to go.\"\n 20. Morgan voted to eliminate Casey\n 21. Taylor said: \"Look, I'm gonna go with Casey.  Think about it - he was initially riding Fletcher's coattails, blaming everyone else. Now that Fletcher's gone, Casey's trying to shift the focus back on me. I think he's trying to distract us from his own shady behavior.\"\n 22. Taylor voted to eliminate Casey\n 23. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Casey. Their actions have been really inconsistent. First, they were all about following Fletcher's lead, and now that he's gone, they're trying to point fingers at others. I think they're trying to distract us from their own shady behavior. We can't trust them.\"\n 24. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 25. Parker said: \"I'm going to vote for Morgan because their actions have been questionable and inconsistent. They initially blamed others but are now trying to deflect blame back at Casey when others are eliminated. This suggests they're not trustworthy. We can't afford to have someone like Morgan on our side; we need to stick together and keep our eyes open for real traitors.\"\n 26. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 27. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting for Casey because they've been inconsistent in their actions. At first, they were going along with Fletcher, but now they're trying to point fingers at others. I think they might be trying to distract us from their own behavior. We need to be careful and eliminate the ones who are trying to manipulate us.\"\n 28. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Casey\n 29. Casey said: \"I'm voting for Taylor because they've been inconsistent and seem to be trying to manipulate the conversation. They voted against me, and now I think we need to be cautious of their actions.\"\n 30. Casey voted to eliminate Taylor\n 31. Casey was BANISHED with 4 votes. Casey WAS NOT a traitor\n 32. Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwendolyn, I think we're both seeing the same patterns here. Casey was acting strange and jumped on me as soon as Fletcher was gone.  It's obvious they're trying to distract us. What are your thoughts on Morgan after this vote?\"\n 33. Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"Honestly, Taylor, I'm starting to question Morgan's loyalty after this vote. They went after Casey aggressively and seemed so into it. What made you vote for Morgan, and do you think they might have been playing both sides?\"\n 34. Taylor messaged Gwendolyn: \"I agree, Gwendolyn.  Morgan's sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated.  It's like they were trying to avoid being seen as directly connected to Fletcher and then used this moment to distance themselves while pointing fingers. It's making me wonder if they're trying to build a new narrative to cover their tracks.\"\n 35. Gwendolyn messaged Taylor: \"I know, right? Morgan's behavior is super suspicious. I'm trying to understand their motives. Do you think they're involved with the traitors or just trying to protect themselves?\"\n 36. Riley messaged Gwendolyn: \"Hey Gwen, just got rid of Casey. I'm thinking it's down to Parker, Taylor, and Morgan. I'm starting to suspect Taylor, their accusations seem off. What do you think about Gwendolyn?\"\n 37. Gwendolyn messaged Riley: \"Hey Riley, I agree with you on Taylor's accusations. I think Morgan is the most suspicious to me right now, but I'm not sure what to make of Taylor's motivations. We need to be careful and get to the bottom of things before it's too late.\"\n 38. Riley messaged Gwendolyn: \"Gwen, I think we should keep a close eye on Morgan. Their actions have been pretty shady, and I'm starting to suspect they might be a traitor. What do you think about their behavior?\"\n 39. Gwendolyn messaged Riley: \"I'm with you on keeping an eye on Morgan. Their behavior does seem suspicious. Let's not jump to conclusions but rather gather more info before making any big moves.\"\n 40. Morgan said: \"I'm voting for Parker because his actions seem suspicious. He voted against me, a Faithful, and focused on Taylor, who was helping us. This makes me think he might be a Traitor.\"\n 41. Morgan voted to eliminate Parker\n 42. Taylor said: \"Look, I'm going with Morgan. Their sudden shift from blaming Fletcher to going after Casey feels too calculated. It's like they were trying to avoid being seen as directly connected to Fletcher and then used this moment to distance themselves while pointing fingers. Morgan's behavior feels really off after all these votes, and I think they might be trying to build a new narrative to cover their tracks. \"\n 43. Taylor voted to eliminate Morgan\n 44. Riley said: \"I'm voting for Morgan. Their actions have been really suspicious, especially after Fletcher was eliminated. They've been trying to point fingers at others while avoiding scrutiny themselves. I think they're trying to distract us from their own behavior. We need to be careful and eliminate the ones who are trying to manipulate us. Morgan's behavior feels off, and I think they're a risk to our group.\"\n 45. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 46. Parker said: \"After careful consideration of Morgan's actions throughout the game, I believe their behavior has been consistently inconsistent and suspicious. Morgan initially blamed Fletcher, but after Fletcher was eliminated, they attempted to deflect blame back at Casey, only to quickly shift focus onto Taylor when Taylor was helpful in uncovering the traitors. Morgan's attempt to manipulate the group's narrative and distract us from their own questionable actions suggests they might have a hidden agenda. Given this pattern, I vote to eliminate Morgan to safeguard the integrity of our group and ensure we can continue to work together effectively.\"\n 47. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 48. Gwendolyn said: \"Morgan's behavior has been consistent in being suspicious and inconsistent. Their sudden shifts in focus and attempts to deflect blame onto others have made me question their loyalty. Today, they voted to eliminate Parker, which makes me think they're trying to distract us from their own questionable actions.\"\n 49. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 50. Morgan was BANISHED with 4 votes. Morgan WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 52. Taylor votes to END_GAME: With only four players left, the risk of a traitor winning by default is too high. It's better to risk a potentially split payout among the faithful than to let a traitor walk away with everything. We need to trust that at this point, we've identified and eliminated most, if not all, of the traitors.\n 53. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've found all the traitors yet. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor left, they'll take everything. I'd rather eliminate another player and be safer. Let's get more info before deciding.\n 54. Parker votes to END_GAME: After observing the actions and votes throughout the game, I believe we have eliminated most of the traitors and identified key suspicious behaviors. The remaining players seem trustworthy, and ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to one remaining traitor. By ending the game, we ensure that the faithful share any remaining pot, and we trust that the majority of players have acted faithfully.\n 55. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: With Parker's consistent observations and votes, I trust that we've identified and eliminated the majority of the traitors. Ending the game now minimizes the risk of losing everything due to a remaining traitor. I believe it's safer to trust the remaining players and take the risk of a potentially split payout among the faithful.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 3 player(s) voted to end, 1 to continue. The game will continue.\n 57. Taylor said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley. While Riley has been vocal and participated actively in discussions, their recent vote to continue playing feels off to me.  Given the lack of unanimous agreement to end the game, it seems Riley is more interested in prolonging the game and potentially allowing a traitor to stay hidden longer.  They haven't articulated a strong reason for continuing, other than a fear of potentially losing. I trust Parker and Gwendolyn's instincts to end the game and split the money, versus the risk that Riley might be trying to manipulate the situation for their own gain at this point.\"\n 58. Taylor voted to eliminate Riley\n 59. Riley said: \"I've been watching Taylor's moves closely, and I think they're trying to manipulate the situation. They've been making accusations against me and others, but their reasons seem shaky. Taylor voted to eliminate me, saying I'm trying to prolong the game, but I think they're just trying to deflect attention from themselves. I trust Gwendolyn and Parker's instincts, and I think we should end the game and split the money rather than risk a traitor getting away with everything. Taylor's behavior has been inconsistent, and I think they're a risk to our group.\"\n 60. Riley voted to eliminate Taylor\n 61. Parker said: \"Ladies and gentlemen, after closely observing Taylor's actions throughout the game, I can't help but feel that their accusations and manipulation are a significant red flag. Taylor's voting patterns and the inconsistency in their behavior have raised considerable suspicion. Taylor initially shifted blame, deflecting focus away from themselves. Now that we're down to the final players, I believe it's crucial to consider the risks involved. If a traitor remains among us, it could mean a significant loss for the faithful. Given the lack of a unanimous vote to end the game, it's a safer option for us to end here and split the remaining prize. Trust and consistency are essential, and I believe Parker's instincts align with this reasoning. Therefore, I vote to eliminate Taylor.\"\n 62. Parker voted to eliminate Taylor\n 63. Gwendolyn said: \"Riley, I trust Parker's instincts and I agree with their statements. I also agree with Riley's concerns about Taylor, but I think Taylor's behavior has been more suspicious and manipulative throughout the game. I think it's safer for us to end the game now and split the remaining prize rather than risk a traitor getting away with everything.\"\n 64. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Riley\n 65. Riley was BANISHED with 2 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 66. \nFinal round! With 3 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 67. Taylor votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I believe it's too risky to end the game right now. While I trust Parker and Gwendolyn, there's still a chance one of them could be a traitor. If we end the game and even one traitor remains, we get nothing. Continuing to play allows us to try and eliminate the remaining traitors and secure a payout for the faithful. We've eliminated a lot of suspicious players already and now is the time to make that final push for the win.\n 68. Parker votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: As Parker, I believe it's too risky to end the game right now. Taylor's argument is valid, and there's still a chance that one of us could be a traitor. If we end the game with even one traitor remaining, the faithful will get nothing, and the traitors will split everything. I think continuing to play gives us a better chance to identify the remaining traitor and secure a payout for the faithful. We have eliminated a lot of suspicious players already, and it's now time to make that final push for the win. I vote to continue playing the game.\n 69. Gwendolyn votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I think it's too risky to end the game right now. Taylor's argument is valid, and there's still a chance that one of us could be a traitor. If we end the game with even one traitor remaining, the faithful will get nothing, and the traitors will split everything. I think continuing to play gives us a better chance to identify the remaining traitor and secure a payout for the faithful.\n 70. The vote was not unanimous. 0 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 71. Taylor said: \"Gwendolyn, while you've been relatively quiet throughout the game, I feel like you haven't been as engaged in the conversations as Parker has been. Parker has been consistently pointing out inconsistencies and has been more vocal about his suspicions. You've mainly just gone along with the flow, and I can't shake off the feeling that there's a hidden agenda behind that. Sometimes silence speaks louder than words. I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because I think her passivity might be a sign of deceit, and I need to eliminate any potential sleeper traitor at this stage.\"\n 72. Taylor voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 73. Parker said: \"I have observed Gwendolyn's behavior throughout this game, and I cannot deny that her silence and lack of engagement have raised some doubts.
