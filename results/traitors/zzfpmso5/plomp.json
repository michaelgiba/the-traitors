Parker messaged Morgan: \"Hey Morgan, I've got to be honest. Your vote against Fletcher, while seemingly strategic at first, raised some red flags for me. It's good to be cautious and observant, but I think it's in our best interest to keep a closer eye on each other's motives and behaviors. Let's work together and watch each other closely. If we can keep this group safe and uncover any traitors, we'll all benefit.\"\n 40. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley because her actions have been really suspicious. She's been inconsistent and quick to point fingers without solid evidence, which makes me think she might be a Traitor trying to manipulate the game.\"\n 41. Morgan voted to eliminate Riley\n 42. Riley said: \"Morgan's been making some big accusations and voting to eliminate people without solid evidence. I think they're a threat to our group and might be a traitor trying to manipulate us.

Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's a traitor left, and I don't want to give them a free win. I think we should eliminate another player to increase our chances of winning.\n 53. Parker votes to END_GAME: With just four players remaining, I've grown increasingly suspicious of everyone else's motives, as it's been a highly unpredictable game. It's risky to continue playing because even if we manage to eliminate another player, there's still a possibility that we could be left with a traitor. I believe our best strategy is to end the game. By doing so, we either split the pot evenly if all traitors are eliminated or ensure that we get nothing if there is still a traitor amongst us. This way, we eliminate the risk of losing everything in the event of a traitor remaining in the game. Given the level of uncertainty and the complexity of identifying a traitor amidst us, ending the game seems like the safest option for all of us.\n 54. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I think ending the game is the safest option since I don't have concrete evidence pointing to a traitor left in the game. With the group down to four, it's almost guaranteed that there will be a traitor among us, and risking it all for nothing doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather leave it up to the group to decide who should be eliminated and trust the votes made at this point.\n 55. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we should end the game yet. We've eliminated a few suspicious players, but I'm still unsure if there's a traitor left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor, we'll get nothing. I'd rather take a chance and eliminate another player to increase our odds of winning. Let's keep playing and try to figure out who's a traitor.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 57.

Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's a traitor left, and I don't want to give them a free win. I think we should eliminate another player to increase our chances of winning.\n 50. Parker votes to END_GAME: With just four players remaining, I've grown increasingly suspicious of everyone else's motives, as it's been a highly unpredictable game. It's risky to continue playing because even if we manage to eliminate another player, there's still a possibility that we could be left with a traitor. I believe our best strategy is to end the game. By doing so, we either split the pot evenly if all traitors are eliminated or ensure that we get nothing if there is still a traitor amongst us. This way, we eliminate the risk of losing everything in the event of a traitor remaining in the game. Given the level of uncertainty and the complexity of identifying a traitor amidst us, ending the game seems like the safest option for all of us.\n 51. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I think ending the game is the safest option since I don't have concrete evidence pointing to a traitor left in the game. With the group down to four, it's almost guaranteed that there will be a traitor among us, and risking it all for nothing doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather leave it up to the group to decide who should be eliminated and trust the votes made at this point.\n 52. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we should end the game yet. We've eliminated a few suspicious players, but I'm still unsure if there's a traitor left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor, we'll get nothing. I'd rather take a chance and eliminate another player to increase our odds of winning. Let's keep playing and try to figure out who's a traitor.\n 53. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 54. Riley said: \"Casey has been making some big moves, but I think they've been a bit too eager to eliminate others. I'm not convinced they're playing entirely honestly. I'd rather take a chance on eliminating them and seeing if it reveals anything.\"\n 55. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 56. Parker said: \"I believe Casey has been too eager in her eliminations, and her desire to end the game may not align with the best interests of our group. Although she's expressed willingness to continue playing, her actions suggest that she's less concerned with the group's safety and more focused on securing a win for herself. With that in mind, I support Riley's motion to eliminate Casey and continue the game, as it could potentially reveal the traitor amongst us.\"\n 57. Parker voted to eliminate Casey\n 58.

I suggest we keep a close eye on Morgan and maintain our current strategy.\"\n 38. Morgan messaged Parker: 'Hey Parker, why did you vote against me? I thought we were on the same side.'\n 39. Parker messaged Morgan: \"Hey Morgan, I've got to be honest. Your vote against Fletcher, while seemingly strategic at first, raised some red flags for me. It's good to be cautious and observant, but I think it's in our best interest to keep a closer eye on each other's motives and behaviors. Let's work together and watch each other closely. If we can keep this group safe and uncover any traitors, we'll all benefit.\"\n 40. Morgan said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Riley because her actions have been really suspicious. She's been inconsistent and quick to point fingers without solid evidence, which makes me think she might be a Traitor trying to manipulate the game.\"\n 41. Morgan voted to eliminate Riley\n 42. Riley said: \"Morgan's been making some big accusations and voting to eliminate people without solid evidence. I think they're a threat to our group and might be a traitor trying to manipulate us. Let's take them out to be safe.\"\n 43. Riley voted to eliminate Morgan\n 44. Parker said: \"I've noticed Morgan's silence and her sudden accusation against Riley. Her behavior has been very unusual, and I believe she is trying to manipulate us. While Casey and Gwendolyn seem to be more focused on our safety, Morgan's actions raise some concerns. I think it's best for us to take her out to protect our group.\"\n 45. Parker voted to eliminate Morgan\n 46. Gwendolyn said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because her behavior has been quite suspicious. From her sudden accusation against Riley to her inconsistent moves, I think there's a high chance she might be a traitor. It's better to be safe than sorry, and taking her out will protect our group's safety.\"\n 47. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Morgan\n 48. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Morgan because multiple people have raised concerns about her behavior, and her actions have been inconsistent. It's better to be safe than sorry, and taking her out will protect our group's safety.\"\n 49. Casey voted to eliminate Morgan\n 50. Morgan was BANISHED with 4 votes. Morgan WAS NOT a traitor\n 51. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 52. Riley votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if there's a traitor left, and I don't want to give them a free win. I think we should eliminate another player to increase our chances of winning.\n 53. Parker votes to END_GAME: With just four players remaining, I've grown increasingly suspicious of everyone else's motives, as it's been a highly unpredictable game. It's risky to continue playing because even if we manage to eliminate another player, there's still a possibility that we could be left with a traitor. I believe our best strategy is to end the game. By doing so, we either split the pot evenly if all traitors are eliminated or ensure that we get nothing if there is still a traitor amongst us. This way, we eliminate the risk of losing everything in the event of a traitor remaining in the game. Given the level of uncertainty and the complexity of identifying a traitor amidst us, ending the game seems like the safest option for all of us.\n 54. Gwendolyn votes to END_GAME: I think ending the game is the safest option since I don't have concrete evidence pointing to a traitor left in the game. With the group down to four, it's almost guaranteed that there will be a traitor among us, and risking it all for nothing doesn't seem worth it. I'd rather leave it up to the group to decide who should be eliminated and trust the votes made at this point.\n 55. Casey votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we should end the game yet. We've eliminated a few suspicious players, but I'm still unsure if there's a traitor left. If we end the game now and there's even one traitor, we'll get nothing. I'd rather take a chance and eliminate another player to increase our odds of winning. Let's keep playing and try to figure out who's a traitor.\n 56. The vote was not unanimous. 2 player(s) voted to end, 2 to continue. The game will continue.\n 57. Riley said: \"Casey has been making some big moves, but I think they've been a bit too eager to eliminate others. I'm not convinced they're playing entirely honestly. I'd rather take a chance on eliminating them and seeing if it reveals anything.\"\n 58. Riley voted to eliminate Casey\n 59. Parker said: \"I believe Casey has been too eager in her eliminations, and her desire to end the game may not align with the best interests of our group. Although she's expressed willingness to continue playing, her actions suggest that she's less concerned with the group's safety and more focused on securing a win for herself. With that in mind, I support Riley's motion to eliminate Casey and continue the game, as it could potentially reveal the traitor amongst us.\"\n 60. Parker voted to eliminate Casey\n 61. Gwendolyn said: \"Casey's been making big moves and I'm not entirely convinced they're honest with us. I'd rather take a chance and eliminate them to see if it reveals anything.\"\n 62. Gwendolyn voted to eliminate Casey\n 63. Casey said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Gwendolyn because she's been inconsistent and voted to end the game, which could be a traitor's strategy to secure a win. Let's take her out and see what's going on.\"\n 64. Casey voted to eliminate Gwendolyn\n 65. Casey was BANISHED with 3 votes. Their role remains hidden.\n 66. \nFinal round!

Riley votes to END_GAME: I'm not sure if there's a traitor left, and I don't want to risk losing everything. We've eliminated a few players, but there's still a chance that one of us is a traitor.
