'Beef' selected as a faithful.\n 2. Game started with the following players: ['Alessandra', 'Beef', 'Braxton', 'Cassandra', 'Dominic', 'Ellis', 'Sudz']\n 3. Braxton messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, what do you think about the others? I'm trying to figure out who might be a Traitor. Maybe we should focus on those who are too quiet or too aggressive.\"\n 4. Beef messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, I'm thinking the same. I don't know much about the others yet, but Alessandra seems kinda suspicious to me, she's been quiet so far.\"\n 5. Alessandra said: \"Alright, I'm voting out Cassandra. She's been pretty quiet, and I feel like she's not giving us much to work with. If we're gonna make it further, we need people who are gonna step up and help the group. I think it's time for her to go.\"\n 6. Alessandra voted to eliminate Cassandra\n 7. Sudz said: \"Ellis has been pretty quiet in the discussions so far, and it seems like they might not be contributing as much as the rest. We need to be strategic and get everyone to work together, and Ellis isn't doing that for us right now. I'm sorry to say it, but I think it's time for Ellis to go.\"\n 8. Sudz voted to eliminate Ellis\n 9. Braxton said: \"Alright everyone, after careful consideration, I'm voting to eliminate Sudz. Sudz has been pretty quiet in our discussions, and while that could be a coincidence, it makes me suspicious. I think it's important we eliminate someone who's not contributing as much to our group, and Sudz's silence makes me question their intentions. Let's keep our group strong and eliminate Sudz.\"\n 10. Braxton voted to eliminate Sudz\n 11. Cassandra said: \"I'm voting Alessandra out.  She was the one to first try and put someone up, and that's not someone I want to be sharing this prize with. \"\n 12. Cassandra voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 13. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Sudz. They've been super quiet throughout our discussions, and it's making me suspicious. I think we need people who are willing to engage and help the group make decisions. Sudz's silence is concerning, and I'd rather err on the side of caution here.\"\n 14. Dominic voted to eliminate Sudz\n 15. Ellis said: \"Sudz has been too quiet and disconnected. Their sudden attack on me smells suspicious\u2014let's eliminate the silence and vote Sudz out now.\"\n 16. Ellis voted to eliminate Sudz\n 17. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Alessandra. She was quick to vote out Cassandra, and now Cassandra's voting out Alessandra. It seems like a personal agenda rather than working for the group's benefit.\"\n 18. Beef voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 19. Sudz was BANISHED with 3 votes. Sudz WAS a traitor\n 20. Cassandra was MURDERED by the traitors.\n 21. Beef messaged Ellis: \"Hey Ellis, I'm glad Sudz got eliminated, they were being super quiet. Now I'm thinking Braxton's next, they're too controlling.\"\n 22. Ellis messaged Beef: \"Agreed, Braxton's too slick. Let\u2019s stick together and make sure he doesn\u2019t manipulate us.\"\n 23. Beef messaged Alessandra: \"Alessandra, you're back! I voted you out earlier, but now I'm thinking you weren't the traitor. What happened to you?\"\n 24. Alessandra messaged Beef: \"Hey Beef, thanks for the vote of confidence! I'm back because the system brought me back after the last round. I know you voted me out earlier, but I don't hold it against you\u2014I get why you did it. Let me tell you, Cassandra was acting super suspicious before she got eliminated. I think she might have been a traitor. We should focus on working together now and take out Ellis next, he's been sketchy too.\"\n 25. Braxton messaged Beef: 'Hey Beef, Sudz was a traitor. We need to stay vigilant. Do you think anyone else is suspicious? Maybe we should watch the quiet ones closely.'\n 26. Beef messaged Braxton: \"Hey Braxton, Sudz was a traitor, but I'm not sure about the others. Alessandra's back, and she's saying Cassandra was suspicious. I'm still thinking about you, you're being pretty controlling.\"\n 27. Alessandra said: \"Alright everyone, I think we should vote out Ellis. He's been pretty quiet and I'm getting a sketchy vibe from him. After what happened with Cassandra, I think we need to be cautious and Ellis's behavior is making me question his intentions. Let's take him out to keep the group strong.\"\n 28. Alessandra voted to eliminate Ellis\n 29. Braxton said: \"I'm voting out Alessandra. Her manipulative behavior and the way she's been pushing eliminations makes me think she's not here to work with the group. Let's eliminate the noise and keep our group strong.\"\n 30. Braxton voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 31. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Beef. His aggressive behavior and constant accusations are making me question his intentions. He's trying to control the narrative and it's coming off as manipulative. I think we need to eliminate the noise and Beef's behavior is concerning me.\"\n 32. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 33.

Ellis voted to eliminate Alessandra\n 35. Beef said: \"I'm voting out Dominic, he's been too accusatory and manipulative, questioning my intentions without solid proof. We need to keep the group strong by eliminating the noise and negativity he's bringing.\"\n 36. Beef voted to eliminate Dominic\n 37. Alessandra was BANISHED with 2 votes. Alessandra WAS a traitor\n 38. \nFinal round! With 4 players remaining,\nthe group must decide whether to end the game or eliminate another player.\n\n 39. Braxton votes to END_GAME: I think we've eliminated the traitors we know about, and it's better to end the game and split the prize. If there's still a traitor, we lose everything, but I'm taking that risk for a chance at the prize.\n 40. Dominic votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not convinced we've got all the traitors out. Alessandra was just revealed as a traitor, and we still have Beef and Ellis left. Their behavior's been shady, and I don't trust them. If we end the game now and there's still a traitor, we faithful lose everything. I'd rather take out one more player to be safe.\n 41. Ellis votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: Braxton is too eager to end things. If there's still a hidden traitor (like Beef or Braxton), we all lose everything. Let's take out one more player to be sure.\n 42. Beef votes to CONTINUE_PLAYING: I'm not sure if we've got all the traitors out. If there's still one and we end the game, we lose everything. Let's eliminate one more player to be safe.\n 43. The vote was not unanimous. 1 player(s) voted to end, 3 to continue. The game will continue.\n 44. Braxton said: \"I'm voting to eliminate Beef. His aggressive behavior and constant accusations make me question his intentions. We need someone who works with the group, not against it. Let's get rid of the noise and keep our group strong.\"\n 45. Braxton voted to eliminate Beef\n 46. Dominic said: \"I'm voting out Beef. His aggressive behavior and constant accusations have been concerning. He's been making wild claims and trying to control the narrative. I think he's a liability to our group and it's time to eliminate the noise. Let's keep our group strong and focused on finding the remaining traitor.\"\n 47. Dominic voted to eliminate Beef\n 48. Ellis said: \"Beef\u2019s constant accusations and aggressive moves have been way too aggressive. His behavior screams 'trouble'\u2014we can\u2019t risk letting him stay.
