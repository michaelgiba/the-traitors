Gwendolyn was BANISHED with 3 votes. Gwendolyn WAS NOT a traitor\n 41. Riley suggests murdering Fletcher: Fletcher has been voting along with the group and seems to be making decisions based on the information they have. However, they voted to eliminate Gwendolyn, who wasn't a traitor, which might indicate they're not the best judge of character. Since Parker seems to be taking control and Fletcher is following their lead, taking out Fletcher might make Parker more isolated and give us an advantage. Plus, Casey's been quiet and might be harder to manipulate.\n 42. Riley votes to murder Casey: Casey's been quiet and playing it safe, which makes them harder to read. Since Parker and Fletcher are likely to be eliminated soon, taking out Casey will leave only faithful players and we can let them sort it out, or we win if there's still a traitor among them.\n 43.
